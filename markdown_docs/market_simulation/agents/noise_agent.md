### FunctionDef __init__(self, symbol, init_price, interval_seconds, start_time, end_time)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the NoiseAgent class, setting up essential parameters for simulating trading behavior within a market environment.

**parameters**:
· symbol: A string representing the financial instrument or asset that this agent will trade.
· init_price: An integer indicating the initial price level of the asset at which the simulation begins.
· interval_seconds: A float value specifying the time interval in seconds between each action or decision made by the agent.
· start_time: A pandas Timestamp object marking the starting point of the simulation period.
· end_time: A pandas Timestamp object denoting the endpoint of the simulation period.

**Code Description**: The constructor initializes a NoiseAgent with specific attributes that define its behavior and environment within a market simulation. It inherits from a superclass, likely an Agent class, initializing it with a fixed amount of cash (1000 units), no communication delay, and no computation delay. These inherited parameters suggest the agent operates in real-time without delays for processing or transmitting information.

The constructor then sets several instance variables:
- `symbol`: Specifies which asset the agent will interact with.
- `init_price`: Sets the starting price of the asset at the beginning of the simulation.
- `start_time` and `end_time`: Define the temporal boundaries within which the agent operates, allowing for simulations over specific time periods.
- `interval_seconds`: Determines how frequently the agent makes decisions or actions during the simulation.

Additionally, the constructor initializes dictionaries that represent probabilities for different aspects of trading behavior:
- `type_probs`: Defines the likelihood of the agent placing a buy ("B") or sell ("S") order. Here, it is equally likely to place either type of order.
- `price_level_probs`: Specifies the probability distribution over price levels relative to the initial price at which the agent might place an order. For example, there is a 35% chance of placing an order at the initial price level (0), and a 15% chance each for prices 100 units above or below the initial price.
- `volume_probs`: Represents the probability distribution over different trading volumes that the agent might choose when placing an order. The most likely volume is 100 units, with decreasing probabilities for larger volumes.

**Note**: This initialization sets up a basic framework for simulating noise trader behavior in a market environment, where decisions are made probabilistically based on predefined distributions of order types, price levels, and volumes. Developers can modify these probability distributions to simulate different trading behaviors or market conditions.

### FunctionDef get_action(self, observation)
**get_action**: This function determines the action to be taken by a noise agent based on the current observation of the market environment. It generates orders for buying, selling, or canceling based on predefined probability distributions and returns an Action object encapsulating these details.

parameters:
· observation: An instance of Observation representing the current state of the simulation as perceived by the agent, including the timestamp, the agent making the observation, and whether it is a market open wakeup event.

Code Description: The function starts by asserting that the agent's ID matches the agent ID in the provided observation to ensure consistency. It then checks if the current time in the observation is before or after the agent's start and end times. If the current time is before the start time, it returns an Action object with no orders and sets the next wakeup time to the start time. Conversely, if the current time exceeds the end time, it returns an Action object with no orders and a None value for the next wakeup time.

If the current time falls within the agent's active period, the function retrieves the latest limit order book (LOB) snapshot using the `get_lob` method. It calculates the mid-price of the market based on the bid prices in the LOB or defaults to an initial price if no bids are available. The function then generates a random order by sampling from predefined probability distributions for order type, price level, and volume using the `_sample` method.

The generated orders are constructed into valid orders using the `construct_valid_orders` method, which takes parameters such as time, symbol, order type, price, and volume. Finally, the function sets the next wakeup time to a specified interval after the current time and returns an Action object containing the agent's ID, the list of generated orders, the current time, and the calculated next wakeup time.

Note: The `get_action` method is crucial for simulating the behavior of noise agents in a market environment. It allows agents to make decisions based on real-time observations and predefined strategies, contributing to the dynamic nature of the simulation.

Output Example: 
Action(time=Timestamp('2023-10-05 14:30:00'), agent_id=1, orders=[LimitOrder(type='B', price=150, volume=10)], next_wakeup_time=Timestamp('2023-10-05 14:35:00'))

### FunctionDef get_lob(self)
**get_lob**: This function retrieves the latest limit order book (LOB) snapshot associated with a specific trading symbol from the agent's internal state.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `get_lob` method is part of an agent class, likely within a market simulation framework. It accesses the current state of a particular trading symbol stored in the agent's `symbol_states` dictionary. This state is expected to be an instance of `TradeInfoState`, which manages trade information for both continuous and call auction periods.

The function first retrieves the `TradeInfoState` object associated with the agent's trading symbol. It then asserts that this retrieved state is indeed an instance of `TradeInfoState`. If there are no trades recorded in the `trade_infos` list (indicating that no trades have occurred yet), the function returns `None`.

If trades have been recorded, the method accesses the last entry in the `trade_infos` list and retrieves its `lob_snapshot`, which represents the most recent state of the limit order book. This snapshot is then returned by the function.

Note: Usage points.
The `get_lob` function is typically used by trading agents to obtain up-to-date information about the market, specifically the current state of buy and sell orders for a particular symbol. This information can be crucial for making informed decisions about placing new orders or adjusting existing ones based on the latest market conditions.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function might return an object representing the limit order book snapshot, which could look something like this:

{
    "bid_prices": [105.75, 105.50, 105.25],
    "ask_prices": [106.00, 106.25, 106.50],
    "bid_volumes": [300, 450, 200],
    "ask_volumes": [250, 375, 400]
}

This example shows the top three bid and ask prices along with their corresponding volumes in the limit order book.
***
### FunctionDef _sample(self, probs)
**_sample**: This function samples an element from a discrete probability distribution defined by a dictionary where keys represent possible outcomes and values represent their corresponding probabilities.

parameters:
· probs: A dictionary mapping each possible outcome to its probability. The sum of all probabilities must equal 1.

Code Description: The _sample method takes a dictionary as input, which contains the possible outcomes as keys and their associated probabilities as values. It uses numpy's random.choice function to randomly select an element from the list of keys based on the provided probabilities. This is particularly useful for simulating scenarios where different actions or events occur with specific likelihoods.

Note: The _sample method is utilized within the get_action method of the NoiseAgent class to determine various attributes of a simulated order, such as its type, price level, and volume, by sampling from predefined probability distributions.

Output Example: If probs = {'buy': 0.6, 'sell': 0.4}, calling _sample(probs) might return 'buy' with a 60% chance or 'sell' with a 40% chance in each invocation.
