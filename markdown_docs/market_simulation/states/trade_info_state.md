## ClassDef TradeInfoState
**TradeInfoState**: A specialized state class designed to encapsulate and manage all trade information during both continuous auction periods and call auction periods within a trading simulation.

attributes:
· trade_infos: A list that stores instances of TradeInfo, representing all trades executed during continuous auction periods.
· call_auction_trade_infos: A list that stores instances of TradeInfo, representing all trades executed during call auction periods.

Code Description: The TradeInfoState class extends the base State class to provide additional functionality for tracking trade information specific to different phases of trading sessions. Upon initialization, it sets up two lists: `trade_infos` and `call_auction_trade_infos`, both initialized as empty lists. These lists are intended to hold instances of the TradeInfo class, which presumably contains detailed information about each trade.

The class includes methods that override those in its superclass State:
- `on_trading`: This method is called when a new trade occurs during continuous auction periods. It first calls the superclass's `on_trading` method to perform any necessary updates defined there (such as updating timestamps and order book snapshots). Then, it appends the provided TradeInfo instance to the `trade_infos` list.
- `on_call_auction_trading`: This method is called when a new trade occurs during call auction periods. Similar to `on_trading`, it first calls the superclass's `on_call_auction_trading` method. Since the base implementation of this method does nothing, this step effectively has no effect unless overridden in future implementations. Afterward, it appends the provided TradeInfo instance to the `call_auction_trade_infos` list.

Note: Usage points.
The TradeInfoState class is utilized within a trading simulation framework to maintain detailed records of all trades executed during different phases of trading sessions. This information can be crucial for analyzing market behavior, evaluating trading strategies, and assessing the performance of agents in the simulation environment. For example, the `NoiseAgent` class retrieves the latest limit order book snapshot from the TradeInfoState instance associated with a particular symbol to make informed decisions about trades. Additionally, functions like `get_trade_infos` can extract trade information within specified time frames for further analysis or visualization purposes. Developers can extend this class or create new subclasses of State to capture and manage other types of state information relevant to their specific trading simulations.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the TradeInfoState class.
parameters:
· None: This constructor does not take any parameters.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the TradeInfoState class, responsible for setting up a new instance with default values. It first calls the superclass's initializer using super().__init__(), which ensures that any initialization logic in the parent class is executed. Two attributes are then initialized:
- trade_infos: An empty list intended to store instances of TradeInfo, representing various trades that have occurred.
- call_auction_trade_infos: Another empty list designed specifically for storing TradeInfo instances related to trades during a call auction period.

These lists serve as containers for collecting and managing trade information throughout the simulation. The TradeInfo class, which is used here, encapsulates details about each trade event, including the order involved, the transactions that resulted from it, and the state of the limit order book at the time of the trade.

Note: Usage points include:
- Initializing a new state to track trades in a market simulation.
- Providing structures (trade_infos and call_auction_trade_infos) for storing detailed trade information, which can be used later for analysis or reporting.
- Facilitating the accumulation of data over multiple trading events within the simulation environment.

### FunctionDef on_trading(self, trade_info)
**on_trading**: This function processes trade information by appending it to a list of recorded trades.
parameters:
· trade_info: An instance of TradeInfo representing the snapshot of trade details including an order, transactions, and the state of the limit order book at a specific point in time.

Code Description: The `on_trading` function is designed to handle incoming trade information during a trading simulation. It first calls the superclass's `on_trading` method, which likely performs some initial or common processing related to trading events. After this, it appends the provided `trade_info` object to an internal list named `self.trade_infos`. This list serves as a collection of all trade snapshots that have occurred during the simulation, allowing for later analysis and review.

The function is crucial for maintaining a record of all trades in the simulation environment. By storing each `TradeInfo` instance, developers can analyze patterns, evaluate trading strategies, or visualize market behavior based on historical data collected throughout the simulation.

Note: Usage points include:
- Collecting detailed trade information for post-simulation analysis.
- Providing a structured way to store and access all recorded trades during a simulation run.
- Facilitating the review and evaluation of trading activities within the simulated market environment.
***
### FunctionDef on_call_auction_trading(self, trade_info)
**on_call_auction_trading**: This function handles the processing of trade information during a call auction trading event. It extends the functionality of its superclass by appending the received `TradeInfo` object to an internal list, thereby maintaining a record of all trades that occur during the auction.

parameters:
· trade_info: An instance of the TradeInfo class representing the snapshot of trade information including order details, transactions, and the state of the limit order book at the time of the trade.

Code Description: The function `on_call_auction_trading` is designed to be invoked when a call auction trading event takes place. It first calls the superclass's implementation of `on_call_auction_trading`, ensuring that any base functionality or setup required by the parent class is executed. Following this, it appends the provided `trade_info` object to the `call_auction_trade_infos` list. This list serves as a repository for all trade information captured during the auction phase, allowing for later analysis and review of trading activities.

Note: Usage points include:
- Collecting detailed trade data during call auctions for subsequent analysis.
- Maintaining a comprehensive record of all trades executed during specific market events such as call auctions.
- Facilitating post-auction reviews or audits by providing structured access to trade information.
