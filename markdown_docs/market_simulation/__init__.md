## FunctionDef _init_logger
**_init_logger**: This function initializes the logging configuration for an application by setting up a root logger that outputs log messages to the standard output (stdout). It configures the log level, format, and handler.

Â· No parameters: The function does not accept any external parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by obtaining the root logger using `logging.getLogger()`. This is the default logger that all other loggers inherit from. Setting the logging level to `INFO` with `root.setLevel(logging.INFO)` ensures that only messages of level INFO and above (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be handled by this logger.

A `StreamHandler` is created using `logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)`, which directs the log output to the standard output stream. The handler's logging level is set to `INFO`, aligning with the root logger's configuration. A formatter is defined using `logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")` to specify the format of the log messages, which includes the timestamp (`%(asctime)s`), the path and line number where the logging call was made (`%(pathname)s:%(lineno)d`), the level of severity of the log message (`%(levelname)s`), and the actual log message (`%(message)s`). This formatter is then set to the handler using `handler.setFormatter(formatter)`.

The handler, now fully configured with its level and format, is added to the root logger via `root.addHandler(handler)`. Finally, an informational log message "init logging" is emitted using `logging.info("init logging")` to indicate that the logging system has been successfully initialized.

Note: Usage points.
This function should be called early in the application's startup process to ensure that all subsequent log messages are captured and formatted according to the specified configuration. It is typically used once per application, as configuring multiple handlers or changing the logger settings after initialization can lead to unexpected behavior. Developers should be aware of the logging levels and formats to effectively use the logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.
