## FunctionDef is_in_period(start, end, time)
**is_in_period**: This function checks if a given timestamp falls within a specified period defined by a start and end timestamp.
parameters:
· start: An optional Timestamp representing the beginning of the period. If None, the function returns False.
· end: An optional Timestamp representing the end of the period. If None, the function returns False.
· time: A Timestamp to be checked against the period defined by start and end.

Code Description: The function first checks if either the start or end timestamp is None. If so, it immediately returns False, indicating that a valid period cannot be determined without both timestamps. If both start and end are provided, the function then evaluates whether the given time falls within this inclusive range (start <= time <= end). It returns True if the time is within the period, otherwise False.

Note: This function is used in various contexts to determine if certain actions or conditions should be applied based on the current timestamp relative to predefined periods. For example, it checks if a specific time is during an auction period in financial exchanges.

Output Example: If start is 10:00 AM, end is 2:00 PM, and time is 1:00 PM, the function will return True because 1:00 PM falls within the period from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM. Conversely, if time were 9:00 AM or 3:00 PM, it would return False as these times are outside the specified range.
## FunctionDef get_ts(date, hour, minute, second, microsecond)
**get_ts**: This function constructs a Timestamp object using specified date components along with time details including hour, minute, second, and optionally microsecond.

parameters:
· date: A datetime.date object representing the year, month, and day.
· hour: An integer indicating the hour of the day (0-23).
· minute: An integer indicating the minute within the hour (0-59).
· second: An integer indicating the second within the minute (0-59).
· microsecond: An optional integer representing microseconds (default is 0).

Code Description: The function takes a date object and time components as input. It then creates and returns a Timestamp object by extracting the year, month, and day from the date object and combining them with the provided hour, minute, second, and microsecond values.

Note: This function is used in various parts of the project to define specific times for market events such as opening, closing, and auction periods. It ensures that all time-related configurations are consistent and accurately represented using Timestamp objects.

Output Example: If called with `get_ts(datetime.date(2023, 10, 5), 9, 30, 0)`, the function would return a Timestamp object representing October 5, 2023, at 9:30 AM.
## FunctionDef get_minute(ts)
**get_minute**: This function extracts the year, month, day, hour, and minute from a given Timestamp object and returns a new Timestamp object containing only these components.

parameters:
· ts: A Timestamp object representing a specific point in time.

Code Description: The get_minute function takes a single argument, `ts`, which is expected to be an instance of the Timestamp class. This class typically represents a date and time with high precision. Inside the function, a new Timestamp object is created using the year, month, day, hour, and minute attributes from the input `ts`. The second, microsecond, and timezone information (if any) are omitted in this new Timestamp object, effectively "zeroing out" these components while preserving the date and time up to the minute level.

Note: Usage points. This function is useful when you need to work with timestamps at a granularity of minutes without considering seconds or finer divisions of time. It can be particularly helpful for grouping events by minute or performing operations that are sensitive only to changes in the minute component of a timestamp.

Output Example: If `ts` is a Timestamp object representing "2023-10-05 14:30:45", then calling `get_minute(ts)` will return a new Timestamp object representing "2023-10-05 14:30".
## FunctionDef elapsed_minutes(start_time, end_time)
**elapsed_minutes**: This function calculates the total number of elapsed minutes between two given timestamps.
parameters:
· start_time: A Timestamp object representing the starting point in time.
· end_time: A Timestamp object representing the ending point in time.

Code Description: The function takes two parameters, both expected to be instances of a Timestamp class. It computes the difference between these two timestamps, converting this duration into seconds using the total_seconds() method. This value is then divided by 60 to convert seconds into minutes and cast to an integer type to get the whole number of elapsed minutes. The result is returned as an integer.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where you need to measure the duration between two events in terms of minutes, such as logging session durations or calculating processing times. It's important to ensure that the Timestamp objects are correctly formatted and represent valid time intervals for accurate results.

Output Example: If start_time is 12:00 PM on January 1, 2023, and end_time is 1:30 PM on the same day, the function will return 90, indicating that 90 minutes have elapsed between these two times.
