### FunctionDef has_event(self)
**has_event**: This function checks if there are any events present in the engine's event queue.
parameters:
Â· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `has_event` method is a simple boolean check that determines whether the internal list `self.events`, which presumably holds event objects, contains one or more elements. It returns `True` if there is at least one event in the queue (i.e., the length of `self.events` is greater than 0), and `False` otherwise.

Note: This function is typically used to check for the presence of events before attempting to process them, ensuring that operations are only performed when necessary. It plays a crucial role in controlling the flow of event processing within an engine or similar system component.

Output Example: If there are no events in the queue, `has_event` will return `False`. Conversely, if one or more events are present, it will return `True`. For instance, after pushing several events into the engine as shown in the provided test case, `has_event` would return `True` until all events have been processed and removed from the queue.

### FunctionDef push_event(self, event)
**push_event**: This function adds an event to the Engine's event queue, ensuring it is properly prioritized based on its time, priority, and a unique identifier.

parameters:
Â· event: An instance of the Event class or any subclass thereof (e.g., MarketCloseEvent). Represents the event to be added to the queue.

Code Description: The function first checks if the provided event is an instance of MarketCloseEvent. If it is, the event_id is set to a predefined high value (1000000000) to ensure that market close events are processed last among all events scheduled for the same timestamp and priority. This prioritization mechanism ensures critical market closure events are handled promptly.

If the event is not a MarketCloseEvent, it assigns an incremental unique identifier using the Engine's _num_event attribute, which keeps track of the number of non-MarketCloseEvents pushed so far. After assigning the event_id, it increments _num_event to ensure the next event receives a different ID. An assertion checks that the assigned event_id does not exceed the maximum allowed value (1000000000), ensuring no overlap with MarketCloseEvent IDs.

The function then uses the heapq.heappush method to add the event to the Engine's events priority queue. The heappush method maintains the heap property of the list, allowing for efficient retrieval of the next event based on its time, priority, and event_id.

Finally, if the Engine's verbose attribute is set to True, the function logs a message detailing the type and scheduled time of the newly received event using the _log method. This logging aids in debugging and monitoring the system's behavior by providing insights into the events being processed.

Note: Usage points include scheduling various types of events such as market open/close events, agent actions, order submissions, etc., by creating instances of the appropriate Event subclasses and passing them to push_event. Developers should ensure that each event is initialized with an accurate timestamp to maintain the integrity of the system's timing mechanisms. Additionally, understanding the priority handling mechanism (time, priority, event_id) is crucial for predicting how events will be processed in relation to one another.
***
### FunctionDef push_events(self, events)
**push_events**: This function adds multiple events to the Engine's event queue by leveraging the `push_event` method. It ensures each event is properly prioritized based on its time, priority, and a unique identifier.

parameters:
Â· events: A list of Event objects or instances of subclasses thereof (e.g., MarketOpenEvent). Represents the collection of events to be added to the queue.

Code Description: The `push_events` function iterates over each event in the provided list. For every event, it calls the `push_event` method, which handles the insertion of the event into the Engine's priority queue. This ensures that all events are correctly prioritized and ready for processing according to their scheduled time, priority, and unique identifier.

The `push_event` method checks if the event is a MarketCloseEvent and assigns it a high event_id to ensure it is processed last among other events with the same timestamp and priority. For non-MarketCloseEvents, it assigns an incremental unique identifier using the Engine's _num_event attribute and increments this attribute for subsequent events. The event is then added to the Engine's events priority queue using `heapq.heappush`, which maintains the heap property of the list.

If the Engine's verbose attribute is set to True, each newly received event is logged with its type and scheduled time, aiding in debugging and monitoring the system's behavior.

Note: Usage points include scheduling various types of events such as market open/close events, agent actions, order submissions, etc., by creating instances of the appropriate Event subclasses and passing them to `push_events`. Developers should ensure that each event is initialized with an accurate timestamp to maintain the integrity of the system's timing mechanisms. Understanding the priority handling mechanism (time, priority, event_id) is crucial for predicting how events will be processed in relation to one another. This function is particularly useful when multiple related events need to be added to the queue at once, such as during the initialization phase of a simulation or trading environment.
***
### FunctionDef run(self)
**run**: This function initiates the main processing loop of an Engine instance, handling events from a priority queue until no more events remain. It tracks time progress using a TimeProgress object and logs the completion status upon finishing.

parameters:
Â· None: The `run` method does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on the internal state of the Engine instance, specifically its `events` heap queue and other attributes like `exchange`, `description`, and `verbose`.

Code Description: The function begins by recording the start time using the `Timestamp.now()` method. A `TimeProgress` object is then instantiated with the exchange's open and close times, a description of the process, and a unit of "s" for seconds. This progress tracker will visually represent the progression of time as events are processed.

The function enters a context manager (`with time_progress.progress`) that initializes and manages the progress bar display. Inside this block, a while loop runs as long as there are events in the `events` queue. Within each iteration, the next event is retrieved from the priority queue and handled accordingly.

A `TimeProgress.update(current_time)` call is made with the current timestamp of the event being processed. This updates the progress bar to reflect how much time has elapsed relative to the total duration between the exchange's open and close times.

After all events have been processed, the function logs a completion message indicating that processing is complete along with the total number of events handled. The `TimeProgress` object ensures that the progress bar accurately reflects the passage of time throughout the event processing loop.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where an Engine instance needs to process a series of timed events, such as in simulations or real-time data handling systems. This method is typically called after pushing events into the engine's queue using `push_events`. The function can be integrated into larger applications requiring temporal event management and monitoring.
***
### FunctionDef _pop_event(self)
**_pop_event**: This function retrieves and removes the next event from the internal priority queue of an Engine instance. The events are managed using a heap data structure, ensuring that the event with the earliest timestamp is processed first. If multiple events share the same timestamp, they are ordered by their priority attribute, and if both attributes are identical, the event_id serves as a tiebreaker.

**parameters**:
Â· None: This function does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on the internal state of the Engine instance, specifically its `events` heap queue.

**Code Description**: The function begins with an assertion to ensure that the `events` list is not empty before attempting to pop an event. This prevents potential runtime errors when trying to access elements from an empty data structure. The `heapq.heappop()` method is used to remove and return the smallest element from the heap, which corresponds to the next event to be processed based on its time, priority, and unique identifier.

After retrieving the event, the function logs a message detailing the type of the event and its scheduled time using the `_log` method. This logging step aids in tracking the sequence of events being handled by the Engine. Finally, the retrieved event is returned for further processing.

**Note**: Usage points. The _pop_event function is primarily used within the `run` and `env` methods of the Engine class to sequentially process all queued events. It ensures that each event is handled in the correct order according to its scheduled time, priority, and unique identifier.

**Output Example**: If the next event in the queue is an instance of MarketCloseEvent with a timestamp of '2023-10-05 14:00', the function will log "handling event, type: MarketCloseEvent, 2023-10-05 14:00" and return the Event object. The returned object might look like this:
Event(time=Timestamp('2023-10-05 14:00:00'), priority=5, event_id=123)

### FunctionDef _add_order_owner_info(self, symbol, order_id, agent_id)
**_add_order_owner_info**: This function adds ownership information of an order to a dictionary within the Engine class. It ensures that each order is uniquely identified by its symbol and order ID, linking it to an agent ID.

**parameters**:
Â· symbol: A string representing the trading symbol associated with the order.
Â· order_id: An integer representing the unique identifier for the order.
Â· agent_id: An integer representing the unique identifier for the agent or entity placing the order.

**Code Description**: The function constructs a key using the combination of the symbol and order ID. It then asserts that this key does not already exist in the `order_owner` dictionary to prevent overwriting existing order information. If the assertion passes, it adds the key-value pair to the `order_owner` dictionary where the value is the agent ID. This ensures that each order can be traced back to its owner uniquely.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where new orders are being processed and their ownership needs to be recorded for tracking purposes. The function is called by `_update_order_owner`, which iterates over a list of accepted orders, adding each one's ownership information using this method. This ensures that all newly accepted orders have their owner information correctly stored in the system.
***
### FunctionDef _del_order_owner_info(self, symbol, order_id)
**_del_order_owner_info**: This function removes order ownership information from an internal dictionary based on a given symbol and order ID.

parameters:
Â· symbol: A string representing the trading symbol of the asset associated with the order.
Â· order_id: An integer that uniquely identifies the order within the system.

Code Description: The function constructs a key using the provided symbol and order ID. It then asserts that this key exists in the `order_owner` dictionary, which presumably maps orders to their owners or related information. If the assertion passes, indicating that the key is indeed present, the function proceeds to remove the entry associated with this key from the `order_owner` dictionary using the `pop` method.

Note: This function is called within the `_on_agent_receive_trading_result` method when an order has been executed and needs its ownership information removed. The removal of order owner information likely signifies that the order has been fully processed or no longer requires tracking in this context. Developers should ensure that the key exists before calling this function to avoid runtime errors, although the assertion within the function helps catch such issues.

### FunctionDef _update_order_owner(self, accepted_orders)
**_update_order_owner**: This function processes a list of accepted orders and updates their ownership information within the system.

**parameters**:
Â· accepted_orders: A list of LimitOrder objects representing orders that have been successfully accepted by the exchange.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over each order in the provided `accepted_orders` list. For each order, it calls the `_update_order_owner` method to record or update the ownership details. This is crucial for maintaining accurate records of which agent or entity owns which orders within the trading system. The ownership information is typically used for tracking purposes, ensuring that transactions and notifications are correctly attributed to the right parties.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where orders have been accepted during either call auction periods or continuous auction periods. This function is called after orders are successfully processed by the exchange in both `_on_exchange_receive_call_auction_orders` and `_on_exchange_receive_continuous_auction_orders`. By updating ownership information immediately after order acceptance, the system ensures that all subsequent actions related to these orders (such as notifications or transactions) are correctly associated with the appropriate agents. This function plays a vital role in maintaining data integrity and facilitating accurate reporting within the trading platform.

### FunctionDef _on_exchange_receive_orders_out_of_trading_period(self, event)
**_on_exchange_receive_orders_out_of_trading_period**: This function handles orders received by the exchange when they are submitted outside of any defined trading period, such as during market closures or non-trading hours.

parameters:
Â· event: An instance of ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent representing the event where an exchange receives orders from agents. It includes attributes like time (when the event occurs), agent_id (the unique identifier of the agent submitting the orders), and orders (a list of BaseOrder objects).

Code Description: The function first retrieves the agent associated with the incoming orders using the agent_id provided in the event. It then creates an AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent to communicate back to the agent about the status of their order submissions. Since the orders were received outside of a trading period, they are neither accepted nor rejected; instead, they are ignored. The function sets the accepted_orders and rejected_orders lists to empty, indicating no changes in these categories. The ignore_orders list is populated with the original orders from the event, signaling that these orders have been ignored due to the current market state. The trans_info and trans_order_id_to_notify fields are set to None because no transactions occurred as a result of these out-of-trading-period orders. Finally, the function uses the push_event method to add this new AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent to the Engine's event queue for future processing.

Note: This function is crucial for managing order submissions during non-trading periods by ensuring that agents are informed that their orders were not processed due to market conditions. It helps maintain accurate tracking of trading activities and ensures that agents can adjust their strategies accordingly based on the feedback received from the exchange. Developers should ensure that this function correctly identifies out-of-trading-period events and communicates the appropriate results back to agents through the event system.

### FunctionDef _on_market_close_event(self, event)
**_on_market_close_event**: This function handles the event triggered when the market closes at a specific time. It performs necessary actions to update the exchange's state and notify each agent about the updated states and the market closure.

parameters:
Â· event: An instance of MarketCloseEvent, which contains the timestamp indicating when the market is closing.

Code Description: The function `_on_market_close_event` begins by calling `self.exchange.market_close(event.time)`, which signals to the exchange that the market has closed at the specified time. This method call does not perform any actions currently but is structured for future functionality related to market closure operations.

Following this, the function iterates over all agents managed by the engine using a dictionary comprehension (`for agent in self.agents.values():`). For each agent, it performs two main tasks:
1. It calls `agent.on_states_update(event.time, self.exchange.states())`, which updates the agent's internal state with the latest market states available from the exchange at the time of market closure.
2. It then calls `agent.on_market_close(event.time)`, notifying the agent that the market has closed and allowing it to perform any necessary actions specific to this event.

The `on_states_update` method is crucial for ensuring that agents have up-to-date information about market conditions before they are notified of the market closure. This synchronization step helps in making informed decisions or performing final calculations based on the latest available data.

The `on_market_close` method, on the other hand, serves as a hook for agents to perform any specific actions required upon market closure. These actions could include finalizing trades, calculating performance metrics, or preparing for the next trading day. This method is intended to be overridden in subclasses of BaseAgent where developers can define custom behaviors.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that this function is correctly integrated into the event handling mechanism of the engine. It should be invoked when a MarketCloseEvent occurs, which typically happens through the `_handle_event` or `_handle_event_generator` methods in the Engine and Env classes respectively. Developers should also ensure that both `on_states_update` and `on_market_close` are properly implemented in any subclass of BaseAgent to handle market closure events effectively.

### FunctionDef _on_call_auction_end(self, event)
**_on_call_auction_end**: This function handles the conclusion of a call auction by matching orders and notifying relevant agents about the executed trades.

parameters:
Â· event: An instance of CallAuctionEndEvent, which includes attributes such as time (the exact moment when the call auction ends), priority (determining the order of processing this event relative to other events occurring at the same time), and event_id (a unique identifier for this specific event).

Code Description: The function begins by calling match_call_auction_orders on the exchange object, passing the time attribute from the CallAuctionEndEvent. This method processes all orders submitted during the call auction period for each symbol configured in the system, matching them according to predefined rules and returning a dictionary of transactions indexed by symbol.

The function then iterates over the values in this dictionary (which are lists of Transaction objects). For each transaction in these lists, it calls notify_agents_on_order_executed. This method is responsible for notifying the relevant agents about the execution of their orders. It identifies which agent owns the executed order based on the transaction details and creates an event to inform that agent about the trading result.

The notification process includes setting various attributes such as the time (adjusted by the agent's communication delay), the agent_id, and detailed information about the executed trade encapsulated in the Transaction object. This ensures that each agent receives accurate and timely information about their orders' execution status.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where call auctions are scheduled within a trading system. After the auction period ends, this function is triggered to handle order matching and subsequent notifications to agents. It plays a crucial role in maintaining fair and orderly market operations by ensuring that all trades executed during the auction phase are properly recorded and communicated to the respective parties involved. Developers should ensure that the CallAuctionEndEvent is correctly generated and handled within the system's event queue to facilitate proper order matching and notification processes.

### FunctionDef notify_agents_on_order_executed(self, time, transaction)
**notify_agents_on_order_executed**: This function is responsible for notifying relevant agents about the execution of an order. It identifies which agent owns the executed order based on the transaction details and then creates an event to inform that agent about the trading result.

parameters:
Â· time: A timestamp indicating when the order was executed.
Â· transaction: An instance of the Transaction class, containing information about the executed trade, including the symbol, type, price, volume, and IDs of the orders involved in the transaction.

Code Description: The function begins by extracting the symbol from the provided transaction object. It then initializes an empty list called `order_ids` to store the IDs of both buy and sell orders involved in the transaction. These order IDs are extended into the `order_ids` list using the `buy_id` and `sell_id` attributes of the transaction.

The function iterates over each order ID in the `order_ids` list, constructing a key tuple consisting of the symbol and the order ID. It asserts that this key exists in the `order_owner` dictionary, which maps (symbol, order_id) tuples to agent IDs. This assertion ensures that every executed order can be traced back to its owner.

For each valid key, the function retrieves the corresponding agent ID from the `order_owner` dictionary and uses it to fetch the associated agent object from the `agents` dictionary. It then creates an instance of the `AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent`, setting various attributes:
- The event's time is set to the execution time plus the agent's communication delay, ensuring that the notification is delivered at the appropriate time.
- The `agent_id` attribute is set to the ID of the agent who owns the order.
- The `accepted_orders`, `rejected_orders`, and `ignore_orders` lists are all empty since this event specifically handles executed orders rather than rejected or ignored ones.
- The `trans_info` attribute is set to the transaction object, providing detailed information about the executed trade.
- The `trans_order_id_to_notify` attribute is set to the current order ID, allowing the agent to identify which specific order was executed.

The newly created event is then pushed into the Engine's event queue using the `push_event` method. This ensures that the notification will be processed at the correct time and in the proper sequence relative to other events.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where orders are executed during continuous auction periods or call auctions. In these cases, after the exchange processes the orders and generates transactions, this function is called to notify the relevant agents about the execution of their orders. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining accurate tracking of trading activities and enabling agents to react appropriately based on the outcomes of their order submissions. Developers should ensure that all necessary information is correctly provided in the transaction object to facilitate proper notification and event handling.

### FunctionDef _check_states_update_time(self, current_time, next_wakeup_time, communication_delay)
**_check_states_update_time**: This function checks whether the calculated states update time, considering a communication delay, is earlier than the current time. If it is, the function raises a ValueError indicating that the next wakeup time should be adjusted to account for network latency.

parameters:
Â· current_time: A Timestamp representing the current point in time.
Â· next_wakeup_time: A Timestamp representing the scheduled time for the next agent action or event.
Â· communication_delay: A Timedelta representing the delay introduced by network communication between agents and the system.

Code Description: The function calculates the states_update_time by subtracting the communication_delay from the next_wakeup_time. It then checks if this calculated states_update_time is earlier than the current_time. If it is, a ValueError is raised with a detailed message explaining why the next wakeup time should be adjusted. The error message includes the minimum required next wakeup time to ensure that the states can be updated before the actual wake-up occurs, taking into account the network latency.

Note: This function is crucial for maintaining synchronization and ensuring timely updates of agent states in systems where communication delays are significant. It is called within the _on_receive_agent_action method to validate the timing of state updates relative to the current time and planned wakeup times. Developers should ensure that the next_wakeup_time provided accounts for any network latency to avoid runtime errors.

### FunctionDef _on_market_open_event(self, event)
**_on_market_open_event**: This function handles the event triggered when the market opens. It performs necessary actions to prepare the trading environment, including notifying the exchange of the market opening time and updating each agent's state with the current symbols available for trading.

parameters:
Â· event: An instance of MarketOpenEvent representing the market open event, which includes a timestamp indicating the exact time the market opens.

Code Description: Upon invocation, the function first calls `self.exchange.market_open(event.time)`, informing the exchange that the market has opened at the specified time. This step is crucial for any setup or logging mechanisms within the exchange related to market opening events.

Next, the function iterates over all agents stored in `self.agents.values()`. For each agent, it calls the `on_market_open` method with the current market open time and a list of symbols available on the exchange. This ensures that each agent initializes its internal data structures for trading these symbols, as described in the documentation for `BaseAgent.on_market_open`.

After updating each agent's state, the function schedules an `AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup` event for each agent. This is done by creating an instance of `AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup` with the current time as both the processing time and wakeup time, setting the `agent_id` to the identifier of the respective agent, and marking it as a market open wakeup (`market_open_wakeup=True`). The newly created event is then added to the Engine's event queue using `self.push_event`.

This scheduling mechanism ensures that agents are ready to perform their next actions in response to the market opening. By pushing these events into the queue, the Engine can manage and process them according to their scheduled times and priorities.

Note: This function plays a critical role in preparing the trading environment for each new market session by ensuring that both the exchange and all agents are properly initialized and ready to handle trading activities. Developers should ensure that this function is correctly invoked when a market open event occurs, typically through an event handler like `_handle_event` or `_handle_event_generator`. Beginners should understand that this function is part of a larger system where various events are processed to simulate a realistic market environment accurately.

### FunctionDef _log(self, msg)
**_log**: This function handles logging messages based on the verbosity setting of an Engine instance.
parameters:
Â· msg: A string message to be logged.

Code Description: The _log function checks if the `verbose` attribute of the Engine class is set to True. If it is, the function prints the provided message twice to the console. This behavior might be intended for debugging purposes or to ensure that important messages are not missed. However, printing a message twice could be considered redundant and may indicate an oversight in the design.

Note: Usage points. The _log function is utilized within several methods of the Engine class, including `push_event`, `run`, `_pop_event`, and `env`. These methods call _log to output information about events being processed or when the processing is complete. This logging mechanism helps track the flow of execution and can be useful for debugging and monitoring the system's behavior.

Output Example: If verbose is True and the function is called with the message "received new event, type: MarketCloseEvent, 2023-10-05 14:00", the output will be:
received new event, type: MarketCloseEvent, 2023-10-05 14:00
received new event, type: MarketCloseEvent, 2023-10-05 14:00
