# Project Documentation: User Management System

## Overview

The User Management System (UMS) is a software application designed to manage user accounts within an organization. It provides functionalities for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving user information securely. This system is essential for maintaining accurate records of users and ensuring that access controls are appropriately managed.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
- **User Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users through login credentials.
- **Profile Management**: Enables users to update their personal information.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns roles to users based on their responsibilities within the organization.
- **Audit Logging**: Keeps a record of all actions performed by users for security and compliance purposes.

## System Architecture

The UMS is built using a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions through a web interface.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Processes data, performs business rules validation, and interacts with the presentation layer.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages database operations such as querying and updating user information.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Selenium for integration tests

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 14.x or higher.
- PostgreSQL database server.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/user-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd user-management-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm install --prefix client
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database by creating a new database and configuring the connection string in `config/database.js`.

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application via your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### User Registration

To register a new user, navigate to the registration page and fill out the required fields including username, email, and password.

### User Authentication

Log in using your registered credentials on the login page. Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

### Profile Management

Once logged in, users can access their profile settings to update personal information such as name, contact details, and password.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Administrators can assign roles to users through the admin panel. Each role has specific permissions that define what actions a user can perform within the system.

## API Documentation

The UMS provides RESTful APIs for interacting with user data programmatically. Below are some example endpoints:

- **GET /api/users**: Retrieve all users.
- **POST /api/users/register**: Register a new user.
- **PUT /api/users/:id**: Update user information by ID.
- **DELETE /api/users/:id**: Delete a user by ID.

### Example Request

To register a new user, send a POST request to `/api/users/register` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Example Response

Upon successful registration, you will receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords are encrypted before being stored in the database.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS**: The application should be served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, refer to the troubleshooting guide available in the `docs` directory of the project repository. For further assistance, contact support@yourdomain.com.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method provides a string representation of a Transaction object, detailing its attributes in a human-readable format.

parameters:
Â· No explicit parameters: The method does not accept any additional parameters beyond the implicit `self` parameter which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The function first asserts that the transaction type is valid by checking if it exists within a predefined set of TRANSACTION_TYPES. It then processes the buy and sell ID lists, converting them into sorted sets to remove duplicates before converting back to lists for string formatting. This ensures that each ID appears only once in the output.

The method formats these IDs into strings with newline and tab characters for better readability. For transactions of type "C" (which likely stands for a certain category like 'cancel'), it outputs a price of "0". Otherwise, it uses the actual price attribute of the transaction.

A formatted string is constructed that includes the time, symbol, type, price, volume, buy IDs, and sell IDs. If there is additional information about matched order volumes (order_matched_volume), this is also included in the output after sorting by keys for consistency.

Note: Usage points include debugging or logging where a clear representation of transaction details is necessary. This method simplifies the process of obtaining such a summary without manually accessing each attribute.

Output Example: 
time 1633072800, symbol: AAPL, type B, price 150, vol 100, bid_ids 101
	102
	103, ask_ids 201
	202, order volume: 101: 50, order volume: 102: 30, order volume: 103: 20,
