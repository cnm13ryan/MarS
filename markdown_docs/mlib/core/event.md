## ClassDef Event
**Event**: The base class of events.
attributes:
· time: Represents the timestamp at which the event occurs.
· priority: An integer value indicating the priority of the event, used for sorting when multiple events occur at the same time.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each event, primarily used for distinguishing between events that have the same time and priority.

Code Description: The Event class serves as a foundational structure for all specific types of events within the system. It initializes with a timestamp indicating when the event should be processed. Each event also has a priority attribute which is crucial for determining the order in which events are handled when they share the same occurrence time. The event_id attribute provides a unique identifier to each event, ensuring that even if two events have identical timestamps and priorities, they can still be distinguished from one another.

The __lt__ method (less than) is overridden to define how Event objects should be compared with each other. This comparison first checks the time attribute; if the times are equal, it then compares the priority attributes. If both the time and priority are identical, the event_id is used as a tiebreaker. This mechanism ensures that events are processed in a consistent order based on their scheduled time, priority, and unique identifier.

Note: The Event class is designed to be extended by other specific event types such as MarketOpenEvent, MarketCloseEvent, AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup, etc., each of which may add additional attributes or behaviors relevant to the specific type of event they represent. This design pattern allows for a flexible and scalable system where new event types can be easily added without modifying existing code.

Output Example: An instance of Event might look like this:
Event(time=Timestamp('2023-10-05 14:30:00'), priority=5, event_id=123)
### FunctionDef __init__(self, time)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Event class with a specified time.
parameters:
· time: A Timestamp object representing when the event is scheduled to occur.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the Event class, responsible for setting up a new instance of an event. It takes one required parameter, 'time', which must be an instance of the Timestamp class and represents the scheduled occurrence time of the event. Upon initialization, this timestamp is assigned to the self.time attribute of the Event object.

Additionally, two other attributes are set with default values:
- self.priority: An integer that defaults to 0. This attribute likely determines the order in which events are processed if multiple events are scheduled for the same time.
- self.event_id: An integer that defaults to -1. This attribute is intended to uniquely identify each event, though it is initialized here without a specific value, suggesting that it may be set later.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of the Event class by providing a Timestamp object as the 'time' parameter. The priority and event_id can be modified after the object has been created if necessary. This initialization method ensures that every event has a scheduled time from the moment it is instantiated, while other properties like priority and event_id are left to be defined or updated later in the lifecycle of the Event object.
***
### FunctionDef __lt__(self, other)
**__lt__**: This function implements the less-than comparison between two Event objects, determining their order based on time, priority, and event_id.
parameters:
· other: Another instance of the Event class to compare with the current instance.

Code Description: The __lt__ method is a special method in Python used for defining the behavior of the less-than operator (<). In this context, it compares two Event objects. First, it checks if the time attributes of both events are equal. If they are, it then compares their priority attributes. If priorities are also equal, it finally compares their event_id attributes to determine which event should be considered "less than" the other. This method is crucial for sorting or comparing events in a list or queue where order matters based on these attributes.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where Event objects need to be sorted or compared, such as in scheduling systems, event-driven simulations, or any application that requires prioritizing tasks or actions based on time and priority.

Output Example: If we have two Event instances, `event1` with (time=3, priority=2, event_id=5) and `event2` with (time=3, priority=2, event_id=4), then `event1 < event2` would return False because the event_id of `event1` is not less than that of `event2`. If we compare `event1` with another Event instance `event3` having (time=2, priority=2, event_id=5), then `event1 < event3` would return False as well since the time of `event1` is greater than that of `event3`.
***
## ClassDef AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup
**AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup**: This class represents an event specifically designed to update the states of an agent and schedule its next wakeup time within a simulation environment, such as a market trading system.

attributes:
· time: Represents the timestamp at which this event should be processed.
· agent_id: An integer identifier for the specific agent whose states need updating.
· wakeup_time: The timestamp indicating when the agent should wake up after its state update.
· market_open_wakeup: A boolean flag that indicates whether this wakeup is triggered by a market opening event.

Code Description: The AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup class inherits from the Event base class, which provides a foundational structure for all events in the system. This inheritance allows the AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup event to utilize and extend the properties and behaviors defined in the Event class. Specifically, it initializes with a timestamp (time), an agent identifier (agent_id), a wakeup time (wakeup_time), and a boolean flag indicating if the wakeup is due to market opening (market_open_wakeup). The priority attribute, inherited from the Event class, is set to 100, which determines its processing order relative to other events. This event plays a crucial role in managing agent activities within the simulation by ensuring that agents are updated and woken up at appropriate times.

The AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup event is handled by specific methods in the Engine class. When this event occurs, it triggers a series of actions including updating the agent's state based on the current market conditions, generating new orders if necessary, and scheduling the next wakeup time for the agent. This process ensures that agents can react to changes in the market environment and make informed decisions.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where an agent needs to be updated with the latest market information or when a market opens, requiring all agents to wake up and potentially generate new trading orders. The event is crucial for maintaining the dynamic interaction between agents and the market within the simulation framework. Developers can utilize this class to simulate realistic agent behaviors in response to various market events. Beginners should understand that this event is part of a larger system where different types of events are processed to simulate a market environment accurately.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, time, agent_id, wakeup_time, market_open_wakeup)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup class, setting up essential attributes related to agent state updates and wake-up times.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp indicating when this event is scheduled to occur.
· agent_id: An integer representing the unique identifier for the agent involved in this event.
· wakeup_time: A Timestamp specifying the exact time at which the agent should be awakened.
· market_open_wakeup: A boolean flag that indicates whether the wake-up is specifically tied to the opening of a market.

Code Description: The __init__ method begins by invoking the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(time). This suggests that AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup likely inherits from another class, possibly an Event class or similar, which handles general event-related attributes such as time. Following this, it initializes several instance variables:
- self.agent_id is set to the provided agent_id, establishing a reference to the specific agent associated with this event.
- self.wakeup_time is assigned the value of wakeup_time, defining when the agent should be awakened.
- self.market_open_wakeup is set based on the market_open_wakeup parameter, indicating if the wake-up is related to market opening times.
- self.priority is hardcoded to 100, which could influence how this event is handled relative to others in a scheduling or processing context.

Note: When creating an instance of AgentStatesUpdateAndWakeup, developers must provide values for time, agent_id, wakeup_time, and market_open_wakeup. The priority attribute is automatically set to 100 and does not need to be specified during instantiation. This setup ensures that each event has a clear schedule, target agent, wake-up specifics, and a predefined processing priority.
***
## ClassDef ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent
**ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent**: Represents an event where an exchange receives orders from agents.

attributes:
· time: A Timestamp indicating when the event occurs.
· agent_id: An integer representing the unique identifier of the agent that submitted the orders.
· orders: A list of BaseOrder objects, each representing an order submitted by the agent.

Code Description: The ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent class extends the Event base class and is specifically designed to handle scenarios where an exchange receives a batch of orders from an agent. It initializes with a timestamp indicating when the event should be processed, an agent_id identifying which agent submitted the orders, and a list of BaseOrder objects representing the orders themselves.

This class plays a crucial role in the simulation or modeling of trading environments, particularly within financial markets where agents (such as traders) submit buy or sell orders to an exchange. The timestamp ensures that the event is processed at the correct time relative to other events in the system, while the agent_id and list of orders provide necessary information for further processing by the exchange.

The ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent class does not contain any additional methods beyond its constructor; it relies on being handled by specific methods within the Engine class. Depending on the current state of the market (e.g., whether it is in a call auction period or continuous trading period), different handlers are invoked to process these orders appropriately. These handlers manage order acceptance, rejection, and notification back to the respective agents.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent when an agent submits orders to the exchange. This event is then pushed into the event queue of the Engine, which processes it at the designated time according to its timestamp. The handling of this event involves checking the current market state and submitting the orders to the exchange for processing during the appropriate auction period or trading session. After processing, results are communicated back to the agent through another event (AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, time, agent_id, orders)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the `ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent` class, setting up essential attributes related to the time of the event, the agent placing the orders, and the list of orders themselves.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp indicating when the order event occurred.
· agent_id: An integer identifier for the agent who placed the orders.
· orders: A list of `BaseOrder` objects representing the orders that are part of this event.

Code Description: The constructor (`__init__`) first calls the superclass's initializer with the `time` parameter, setting up any time-related attributes inherited from the parent class. It then assigns the `agent_id` to an instance variable, which identifies the agent responsible for placing these orders. Finally, it stores the list of `BaseOrder` objects in an instance variable named `orders`. This setup is crucial for tracking and managing order events within a trading system, allowing for detailed record-keeping and processing based on when and by whom orders were placed.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of `ExchangeReceiveOrdersEvent` whenever there is a need to log or process a batch of orders at a specific time from a particular agent. This class would be integral in systems where order events are logged for auditing, analysis, or further processing such as execution or cancellation. Developers can extend this class if additional functionality related to order events needs to be implemented.
***
## ClassDef AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent
**AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent**: This class represents an event where an agent receives the trading results from the exchange after submitting orders. It inherits from the base `Event` class, extending its functionality to include specific details about the outcome of order submissions.

attributes:
· time: Represents the timestamp at which the event occurs.
· agent_id: An integer identifier for the agent receiving the trading result.
· accepted_orders: A list of `LimitOrder` objects that were successfully accepted by the exchange.
· rejected_orders: A list of `BaseOrder` objects that were rejected by the exchange.
· ignore_orders: A list of `BaseOrder` objects that were ignored or not processed by the exchange.
· trans_info: An optional `Transaction` object containing information about a transaction if one occurred.
· trans_order_id_to_notify: An optional integer representing the order ID to notify in case of a transaction.

Code Description: The `AgentReceiveTradingResultEvent` class is designed to encapsulate all relevant information regarding the outcome of an agent's trading activities. It inherits from the `Event` class, which provides it with a timestamp (`time`) indicating when this event should be processed. Additionally, it includes several attributes that detail the results of order submissions:

- `agent_id`: This attribute uniquely identifies the agent who submitted the orders and is receiving the results.
- `accepted_orders`: A list of `LimitOrder` objects that were successfully accepted by the exchange. These are orders that have been matched or placed in the order book.
- `rejected_orders`: A list of `BaseOrder` objects that were rejected by the exchange. This could be due to various reasons such as insufficient funds, invalid order parameters, or market conditions.
- `ignore_orders`: A list of `BaseOrder` objects that were ignored by the exchange. These orders might not have been processed for reasons like being out of trading hours or other specific criteria set by the exchange.
- `trans_info`: An optional attribute that contains a `Transaction` object if a transaction occurred as a result of the order submission. This provides details about the executed trade, such as price and volume.
- `trans_order_id_to_notify`: An optional integer used to specify which order ID should be notified in case of a transaction. This is useful for tracking specific orders that have been executed.

The class initializes these attributes through its constructor, ensuring that all necessary information is captured when an instance of the event is created. The event can then be processed by the system's event handling mechanisms, such as those found in the `Engine` class methods `_on_agent_receive_trading_result`, `_on_exchange_receive_call_auction_orders`, `_on_exchange_receive_continuous_auction_orders`, and `_on_exchange_receive_orders_out_of_trading_period`. These methods handle the event by updating the agent's state based on the trading results, notifying agents of executed orders, and managing order ownership information.

Note: Usage points. This class is crucial for maintaining accurate tracking of trading activities within the system. It allows agents to react appropriately to the outcomes of their order submissions, which can include adjusting strategies, managing resources, or responding to market conditions. The inclusion of detailed transaction information (`trans_info`) and specific order notifications (`trans_order_id_to_notify`) ensures that agents are well-informed about the execution status of their orders, facilitating effective trading operations.

## ClassDef MarketOpenEvent
**MarketOpenEvent**: Represents a specific type of event indicating when the market opens. This class extends the base Event class and inherits its attributes and methods, adding no additional attributes or behaviors specific to itself.

attributes:
· time: Represents the timestamp at which the market open event occurs.
· priority: An integer value indicating the priority of the market open event, used for sorting when multiple events occur at the same time. By default, this is inherited from the Event class and set to 0.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each market open event, primarily used for distinguishing between events that have the same time and priority. This is also inherited from the Event class.

Code Description: The MarketOpenEvent class serves as a specific implementation of an event within the system, indicating when the market opens. It leverages the foundational structure provided by the Event base class to manage its timing, priority, and unique identification. Since it does not introduce any new attributes or methods, all functionality related to handling these events is managed through the inherited properties and behaviors from the Event class.

The MarketOpenEvent is utilized in various parts of the system where market opening times are significant. For example, it triggers specific actions such as waking up agents (entities that participate in trading activities) and updating their states when the market opens. This ensures that all participants are ready to engage in trading activities at the designated time.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of MarketOpenEvent with a specific timestamp indicating when the market should open, pushing these events into an event queue for processing, and handling them appropriately within the system's engine or environment components. The creation of such events is often automated through functions like create_exchange_events, which generate a series of events based on predefined configurations, including market opening times.
## ClassDef MarketCloseEvent
**MarketCloseEvent**: Represents a market close event within the trading system.
attributes:
· time: The timestamp at which the market is scheduled to close.
· priority: An integer value indicating the priority of the event, used for sorting when multiple events occur at the same time.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each event, primarily used for distinguishing between events that have the same time and priority.

Code Description: The MarketCloseEvent class inherits from the Event base class, which provides a foundational structure for all specific types of events within the system. This particular event type is specifically designed to represent the closure of a market at a designated time. When an instance of MarketCloseEvent is created, it must be initialized with a timestamp indicating when the market should close.

The MarketCloseEvent class inherits attributes and methods from its parent Event class:
- The `time` attribute specifies the exact moment when the market is scheduled to close.
- The `priority` attribute determines the order in which this event will be processed relative to other events that occur at the same time. This is particularly useful for ensuring that critical events, such as market closures, are handled promptly and in a consistent order.
- The `event_id` attribute provides a unique identifier for each event instance, allowing differentiation between events with identical timestamps and priorities.

The MarketCloseEvent class does not add any additional attributes or methods of its own. Instead, it relies on the functionality provided by the Event base class to manage its properties and behavior. This design pattern allows for a flexible and scalable system where new event types can be easily added without modifying existing code.

When a MarketCloseEvent is pushed into the event queue of an Engine instance, it is assigned a unique `event_id`. If the event is specifically a MarketCloseEvent, it is given a predefined high `event_id` value (1000000000) to ensure it has a higher priority in the queue compared to other events with the same time and priority. This ensures that market closure events are processed last among all events scheduled for the same timestamp.

The Engine class handles MarketCloseEvent instances by invoking the `_on_market_close_event` method, which performs actions such as closing the market on the exchange and notifying agents about the market closure. This method updates the state of the exchange to reflect the closed status and informs each agent about the updated states and the market closure event.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of MarketCloseEvent with a specific timestamp to schedule a market closure, pushing this event into the Engine's event queue, and ensuring that it is processed correctly by the system. Developers should ensure that the `time` attribute accurately reflects the intended market closure time to maintain the integrity of the trading simulation or real-time system.
## ClassDef CallAuctionStartEvent
**CallAuctionStartEvent**: Represents an event indicating the start of a call auction within the trading system.

attributes:
· time: A Timestamp object representing the exact moment when the call auction starts.
· priority: An integer value that determines the order of processing for events occurring at the same time. Lower values indicate higher priority.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each event, used to distinguish between events with identical timestamps and priorities.

Code Description: The CallAuctionStartEvent class extends the Event base class, inheriting its attributes and methods. This specific event type is utilized within the trading system to signify when a call auction begins. The time attribute specifies the exact moment of the auction's start, which is crucial for scheduling purposes. The priority attribute allows the system to manage events efficiently by determining their processing order in cases where multiple events are scheduled for the same time. Lastly, the event_id provides a unique identifier for each event instance, ensuring that every event can be uniquely tracked and managed.

The CallAuctionStartEvent class does not introduce any additional attributes or methods beyond those inherited from the Event base class. It is primarily used as an indicator within the system to trigger specific actions related to the start of a call auction. This could include initializing auction parameters, notifying relevant agents, or preparing the exchange for incoming orders.

Note: Instances of CallAuctionStartEvent are typically created and managed by higher-level components such as the Engine or Env classes. These components handle the scheduling and processing of events according to their timestamps and priorities. The creation of CallAuctionStartEvent instances is often automated through functions like create_exchange_events, which generate a series of events based on predefined configurations. Developers should ensure that each event has a unique event_id to avoid conflicts during event handling.
## ClassDef CallAuctionEndEvent
**CallAuctionEndEvent**: Represents an event indicating the end of a call auction process.

attributes:
· time: A Timestamp object representing the exact moment when the call auction ends.
· priority: An integer value that determines the order of processing this event relative to other events occurring at the same time. Lower values indicate higher priority.
· event_id: A unique identifier for this specific event, used to distinguish it from other events with identical timestamps and priorities.

Code Description: The CallAuctionEndEvent class is a specialized type of Event that signifies the conclusion of a call auction phase in a trading system. It inherits all attributes and methods from its base class, Event, which includes time, priority, and event_id. These attributes are crucial for scheduling and prioritizing the event within the system's event queue.

The primary purpose of the CallAuctionEndEvent is to trigger specific actions once the call auction period has ended. This typically involves matching orders that were submitted during the call auction phase and notifying relevant agents about the results of these matches. The handling of this event is managed by methods in classes such as Engine, where the _on_call_auction_end method processes the event by calling match_call_auction_orders on the exchange object to execute trades and then notifies agents about the executed orders.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of CallAuctionEndEvent when setting up auction schedules for a trading system. These events are usually generated alongside other market-related events such as MarketOpenEvent, MarketCloseEvent, and others, ensuring that all critical phases of trading operations are properly scheduled and handled in sequence. The creation and handling of these events are typically managed by functions like create_exchange_events, which generate a list of events based on the provided trade configuration.
## ClassDef ContinuousAuctionStartEvent
**ContinuousAuctionStartEvent**: Represents an event indicating the start of a continuous auction.

attributes:
· time: The timestamp at which the continuous auction starts.
· priority: An integer value indicating the priority of the event, used for sorting when multiple events occur at the same time.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each event, primarily used for distinguishing between events that have the same time and priority.

Code Description: ContinuousAuctionStartEvent is a subclass of the Event class. It inherits all attributes and methods from its parent class, including the initialization with a timestamp (time), an optional priority attribute, and a unique event_id. This specific event type is used to signify the beginning of a continuous auction in the trading system.

The ContinuousAuctionStartEvent does not add any additional attributes or methods beyond those inherited from Event. It serves as a marker for when the continuous auction phase starts, which can be crucial for systems that need to perform actions or calculations specifically during this period.

This event is handled by the _handle_event method in the Engine class and the _handle_event_generator method in the Env class. In both methods, ContinuousAuctionStartEvent is recognized but does not trigger any specific action beyond being acknowledged as a valid event type. This design allows for flexibility in how different types of events are processed without requiring changes to existing code.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of ContinuousAuctionStartEvent when setting up the trading schedule or during runtime when an auction phase transition occurs. These instances should be added to the event queue with appropriate timestamps and priorities to ensure they are processed at the correct time relative to other events in the system.
## ClassDef ContinuousAuctionEndEvent
**ContinuousAuctionEndEvent**: Represents an event indicating the end of a continuous auction period.

attributes:
· time: The timestamp at which the continuous auction ends.
· priority: An integer value indicating the priority of the event, used for sorting when multiple events occur at the same time.
· event_id: A unique identifier assigned to each event, primarily used for distinguishing between events that have the same time and priority.

Code Description: ContinuousAuctionEndEvent is a subclass of the Event class. It inherits all attributes and methods from its parent class, specifically designed to denote the conclusion of a continuous auction period in an exchange or trading system. The primary attribute inherited from the Event class is 'time', which specifies when this event should be processed. This timestamp is crucial for scheduling and handling the event at the correct moment during the simulation or real-time operation of the market.

The 'priority' attribute allows the ContinuousAuctionEndEvent to be sorted relative to other events that may occur simultaneously. A lower priority value indicates a higher urgency, meaning this event will be processed before others with a higher priority number when they share the same timestamp. This prioritization mechanism ensures that critical events are handled in an orderly fashion.

The 'event_id' attribute provides each ContinuousAuctionEndEvent with a unique identifier. Even if two events have identical timestamps and priorities, their distinct event_ids ensure they can be uniquely identified and managed within the system.

In the context of the trading engine or simulation environment, the ContinuousAuctionEndEvent is used to signal that the continuous auction phase has ended. This event triggers specific actions such as transitioning to a different market state, processing any remaining orders from the continuous auction period, or preparing for subsequent auction phases like call auctions or market closures.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of ContinuousAuctionEndEvent with appropriate timestamps and adding them to the event queue in the trading engine. These events are then processed by methods such as _handle_event in Engine or _handle_event_generator in Env, where specific actions are taken based on the type of event received. The creation of these events is typically handled by functions like create_exchange_events, which generate a series of market-related events according to predefined configurations.
