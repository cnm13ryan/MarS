## ClassDef Level
**Level**: Represents a price level in an order book containing orders at a specific price point.
attributes:
· price: The price of the level, representing the price at which all orders within this level are placed.
· volume: The total volume of all orders at this price level.
· orders: A dictionary mapping each order's ID to its corresponding LimitOrder object.

Code Description: 
The Level class is designed to encapsulate a specific price point in an order book, where multiple orders can exist. Each instance of the Level class holds information about the price level, the total volume of orders at that price, and all individual orders placed at that price. The constructor initializes these attributes and performs a check to ensure data integrity.

The `volume` attribute is defined as a property, allowing read-only access to the total volume of orders in this level. Similarly, the `orders` attribute provides a view of all orders within this level by returning their values from the internal dictionary.

The method `has_order_id` checks if an order with a given ID exists at this price level. The `update_with_cancel_order` method handles the cancellation of an order, adjusting the volume and removing the order if its volume reaches zero. It also creates a transaction record for the cancellation.

The `add_new_order` method adds a new order to the level, updating the total volume accordingly. This method ensures that the price of the new order matches the level's price and that the order has a positive volume.

The `update_with_clear_order` method processes an incoming buy or sell order by matching it with existing orders at this price level. It updates volumes, removes fully matched orders, and returns details about the matched orders.

The `check` method is used to validate the integrity of the Level instance, ensuring that all orders have the same price as the level and that the total volume matches the sum of individual order volumes.

Note: The Level class plays a crucial role in maintaining an accurate representation of orders at specific price points within an order book. It ensures data consistency through assertions and provides methods to manage order lifecycle events such as adding, canceling, and matching orders.

Output Example: 
Creating a Level instance with a price of 100, volume of 300, and two orders:
```python
level = Level(price=100, volume=300, orders=[LimitOrder(order_id=1, price=100, volume=150), LimitOrder(order_id=2, price=100, volume=150)])
```
The `repr` method would output:
```
price 100, volume 300
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, price, volume, orders)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Level class, representing a price level in an order book system.

parameters:
· price: An integer representing the price at this level.
· volume: An integer representing the total volume of orders at this price level.
· orders: A list of LimitOrder objects that are part of this price level.

Code Description: The __init__ method sets up a new instance of the Level class with specified price and volume. It also initializes a dictionary to map order IDs to their corresponding LimitOrder objects for efficient access. After setting these attributes, it calls the check method to validate the integrity of the orders within this price level. This validation ensures that all orders have the correct price and that the total volume accurately reflects the sum of individual order volumes.

Note: Usage points include initializing a new price level in an order book system with specific prices, volumes, and associated orders. The initialization process includes immediate validation to maintain data integrity, which is crucial for accurate trading operations. Developers can rely on this method to set up consistent and error-free price levels within their order book implementations.

### FunctionDef volume(self)
**volume**: This function retrieves the total volume of orders at a specific price level within an order book.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `volume` method is defined within a class, likely representing a price level in an order book system. It returns the value stored in the private attribute `_volume`, which holds the total volume of orders at that particular price level. This method provides a straightforward way to access the volume information without directly interacting with the internal state of the object.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to check or utilize the total volume of orders at a specific price level for calculations, reporting, or further processing within trading algorithms or systems.

Output Example: If the `_volume` attribute is set to 150, calling `level.volume()` would return `150`, indicating that there are 150 units of volume available at this price level.
***
### FunctionDef orders(self)
**orders**: This function retrieves a list of orders from the current level instance.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `orders` method is defined within a class, likely representing a level in an order book system (given the context). It accesses a private attribute `_orders`, which is expected to be a dictionary where keys are identifiers for orders and values are the order objects themselves. The method returns the values of this dictionary, effectively providing all order objects stored at the current level.

Note: This function is used in scenarios where one needs to access or manipulate all orders within a specific price level of an order book. It serves as a simple getter for the internal `_orders` attribute, making it easier for other parts of the system to interact with the orders without needing direct access to the private attribute.

Output Example: Assuming that the `_orders` dictionary contains two entries, the output might look like this:
[
    Order(order_id=101, price=150.75, quantity=20),
    Order(order_id=102, price=150.75, quantity=30)
]
Where `Order` is a class representing an order in the system with attributes such as `order_id`, `price`, and `quantity`.
***
### FunctionDef has_order_id(self, id)
**has_order_id**: This function checks if a given order ID exists within the orders of a specific level.
parameters:
· id: An integer representing the order ID to be checked.

Code Description: The function `has_order_id` takes an integer `id` as its parameter and returns a boolean value. It checks whether this `id` is present in the `_orders` attribute, which is assumed to be a collection (such as a list or set) of order IDs associated with the level instance. If the `id` is found within `_orders`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Note: This method is utilized by other parts of the system, such as in the `get_price_of_order_id` method of the `Orderbook` class. In that context, `has_order_id` helps determine if an order with a specific ID exists within any level (either ask or bid) of the order book.

Output Example: If the `_orders` attribute contains the IDs [101, 203, 456] and the function is called with `id=203`, it will return `True`. Conversely, if called with `id=999`, which is not in the list, it will return `False`.

### FunctionDef add_new_order(self, new_order)
**add_new_order**: This function adds a new limit order to an existing level within an order book. It updates the total volume of the level and stores the new order using its unique identifier.

**parameters**:
· new_order: An instance of the LimitOrder class representing the order to be added.

**Code Description**: The `add_new_order` method is part of a class that manages levels in an order book, where each level corresponds to a specific price. When this function is called with a `new_order`, it performs several key operations:

1. **Volume Update**: It increases the `_volume` attribute of the current level by the volume of the new order. This ensures that the total volume at this price level accurately reflects all orders present.

2. **Order Storage**: The method stores the new order in a dictionary, `_orders`, using the order's unique identifier (`order_id`) as the key. This allows for efficient retrieval and management of individual orders within the level.

3. **Assertion Checks**:
   - It asserts that the price of the `new_order` matches the price of the current level. This is crucial because each level in an order book corresponds to a specific price, and adding an order with a different price would be incorrect.
   - It also asserts that the volume of the new order is greater than zero. This ensures that only valid orders are processed.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where a new limit order needs to be added to an existing level in the order book. For example, when processing incoming buy or sell orders during trading operations, this function is called to update the relevant price level with the new order details. It plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the order book data structure.

### FunctionDef check(self)
**check**: This function performs validation checks on the orders within a specific price level of an order book to ensure data integrity.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `check` method is part of a class that represents a price level in an order book system. It iterates through each order stored in the `_orders` dictionary, which maps order IDs to `LimitOrder` objects. For each order, it performs two assertions:
1. It checks that the price of the current order matches the price of the price level (`self.price == order.price`). This ensures that all orders within a specific price level have the correct price.
2. It verifies that the volume of the price level is greater than zero (`self.volume > 0`), indicating that there are active orders at this price level.

After checking individual orders, the method performs an additional check on the total volume:
- If there are no orders in `_orders`, it asserts that the total volume (`self._volume`) should be zero. This ensures consistency when a price level has been emptied of all orders.
- If there are orders present, it calculates the sum of volumes from all individual orders and asserts that this sum matches `self._volume`. This step confirms that the stored total volume accurately reflects the combined volume of all active orders at this price level.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where the integrity of order data needs to be verified after updates or modifications. The `check` method is called during initialization (`__init__`) and after updating the price level with cancel or clear operations (`update_with_cancel_order`, `update_with_clear_order`). This ensures that any changes made to the order book maintain consistency and correctness, preventing issues such as discrepancies in volume calculations or incorrect price associations. Developers can rely on this method to catch errors early in the process, ensuring robustness in trading algorithms and systems.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This method provides an official string representation of the Level object, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter that refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __repr__ method is a special Python method used to define the string representation of an object. This particular implementation returns a formatted string that includes the price and volume attributes of the Level object. The string format is designed to be informative, showing both the attribute names (price and volume) and their corresponding values. The price is accessed directly from the self.price attribute, while the volume is retrieved from the protected attribute self._volume.

Note: Usage points.
This method is automatically invoked when you use the built-in repr() function on an instance of the Level class or when you inspect an object in an interactive Python shell. It is intended to provide a clear and unambiguous representation of the object, which can be particularly helpful for developers during debugging sessions.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If there were an instance of Level with a price of 100 and a volume of 50, calling repr() on this instance would produce the following string:
price 100, volume 50
