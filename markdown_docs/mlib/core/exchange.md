## ClassDef Exchange
**Exchange**: The Exchange class represents a financial market exchange where trading activities such as order submission, auction periods management, and state registration take place.

attributes:
· exchange_config: An instance of ExchangeConfig that contains configuration details for the exchange including symbols traded, auction times, and other relevant parameters.
· _orderbooks: A dictionary mapping each symbol to its corresponding Orderbook object which manages buy and sell orders for that symbol.
· snapshot_levels: The number of levels in the order book snapshot.
· _symbol_states: A nested dictionary where the outer key is a symbol and the inner key is the name of a state class. This structure holds instances of State objects associated with each symbol.
· _cur_order_id: An integer representing the current order ID, used to assign unique IDs to new orders.

Code Description: The Exchange class initializes with an exchange configuration, sets up order books for each symbol listed in the configuration, and initializes states for these symbols. It provides methods to manage market opening and closing times, register state objects that track various aspects of trading, submit orders during call and continuous auction periods, match orders, and retrieve snapshots of current states and order books.

The class includes methods like `market_open` and `market_close` which are placeholders for logging or other actions when the market opens or closes. The `_init_exchange` method initializes the order books and symbol states based on the provided configuration. The `register_state` method allows adding state objects to track specific trading conditions or events.

Order submission is handled by `submit_call_auction_order` and `submit_continuous_auction_order`, which process orders during call auction periods (open and close auctions) and continuous auction periods respectively. These methods update the order books and notify registered states about new trades.

The `match_call_auction_orders` method matches orders during call auction periods, handling both open and close auctions. It updates states with information about matched transactions and cancellations.

The `states_snapshot` method provides a deep copy of the current state objects for each symbol, useful for saving or analyzing the state without affecting the live trading environment. The `get_lob` method returns the order book for a specific symbol.

Note: Usage points include initializing an Exchange object with a valid configuration, registering necessary states to track trading conditions, submitting orders during appropriate auction periods, and retrieving snapshots of current states and order books for analysis or reporting.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
When calling `submit_continuous_auction_order` with a valid BaseOrder, it might return a list of TradeInfo objects representing the trades that occurred as a result of submitting the order. Each TradeInfo object contains details about the trade such as the order involved, transactions executed, and a snapshot of the limit order book at the time of the trade.

Example:
```python
trade_infos = exchange.submit_continuous_auction_order(base_order)
# trade_infos might look like this:
[
    TradeInfo(
        order=LimitOrder(...),
        trans=[Transaction(...), Transaction(...)],
        lob_snapshot=OrderbookSnapshot(...)
    ),
    # ... more TradeInfo objects for other trades resulting from the base_order
]
```

### FunctionDef market_open(self, time)
**market_open**: This function is designed to handle the event of a market opening at a specified time. It currently does not perform any actions but is structured to accept a timestamp indicating when the market opens.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp object representing the exact moment the market opens.

Code Description: The function `market_open` takes a single parameter, `time`, which is expected to be of type `Timestamp`. This parameter indicates the specific time at which the market is considered open. Currently, the function body contains only a pass statement, meaning it does nothing when called. However, based on its context within the project and how it is invoked by other parts of the system, such as in the `_on_market_open_event` method of the `Engine` class, it can be inferred that this function is intended to serve as a hook or placeholder for future functionality related to market opening events.

Note: Usage points. This function is called within the `_on_market_open_event` method of the `Engine` class when a market open event occurs. During this call, the function receives the time at which the market opens from the `MarketOpenEvent`. Although currently non-functional, it is likely intended to be expanded in future development to include actions that should occur upon the market opening, such as initializing certain states or notifying other components of the system about the market's status change. Developers and beginners should be aware that while this function does not perform any operations at present, its role within the application architecture suggests it is a critical point for handling market open events in the future.
***
### FunctionDef market_close(self, time)
**market_close**: This function is designed to handle the event of a market closing at a specified time. It currently does not perform any actions but is structured to be extended for future functionality.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp object representing the exact time when the market closes.

Code Description: The function `market_close` accepts a single parameter, `time`, which is expected to be of type `Timestamp`. This parameter indicates the precise moment at which the market is considered closed. At present, the function contains only a pass statement, meaning it does nothing when called. However, based on its name and context within the project structure, it is intended to serve as a placeholder for any operations that need to be executed upon the closure of the market.

Note: Usage points. This function is invoked by the `_on_market_close_event` method in the `Engine` class. When a `MarketCloseEvent` occurs, this event triggers the `market_close` method on an instance of the `Exchange` class, passing the event's time as an argument. Following the call to `market_close`, the `_on_market_close_event` method also updates the states for each agent in the system and notifies them of the market closure. This sequence of events suggests that `market_close` is part of a larger mechanism for managing market state transitions and communicating these changes to other components within the system. Developers should consider implementing any necessary logic within this function to handle the consequences of a market closing, such as finalizing trades, updating market data, or preparing for the next trading session.
***
### FunctionDef _init_symbol_states(self)
**_init_symbol_states**: Initializes a dictionary to store state information for each trading symbol managed by the exchange.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `_init_symbol_states` is responsible for setting up an internal data structure within the `Exchange` class that will hold state objects for each trading symbol configured in the exchange. The primary purpose of this dictionary, `_symbol_states`, is to maintain a mapping between each trading symbol and its corresponding states.

Upon invocation, the function initializes `_symbol_states` as an empty dictionary where keys are trading symbols (strings) and values are dictionaries that will eventually map state class names to instances of those state classes. The outer dictionary is populated by iterating over `self.config.symbols`, which is expected to be a list or iterable containing all the trading symbols managed by the exchange.

For each symbol in the configuration, an empty dictionary is created as its value within `_symbol_states`. This inner dictionary will later hold instances of various state classes (subclasses of `State`), with keys being the names of these state classes. The setup allows for flexible management and retrieval of different states associated with each trading symbol.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called during the initialization phase of an exchange instance, as indicated by its call within `_init_exchange`. By setting up `_symbol_states`, the exchange prepares to manage and update various aspects of trading sessions for each symbol, such as open and close prices, volumes, timestamps, and snapshots of the limit order book. This structured approach ensures that all relevant state information is organized and easily accessible throughout the simulation or operation of the exchange. Developers can extend this structure by adding more specialized state classes that inherit from `State`, allowing for a modular and scalable design in managing trading states.
***
### FunctionDef register_state(self, state)
**register_state**: This function registers a state object to be associated with each trading symbol managed by the exchange.

parameters:
· state: An instance of the State class, representing the state to be registered for each symbol.

Code Description: The `register_state` method is designed to associate a given state object with every trading symbol that the exchange manages. This association allows the exchange to maintain and update specific states relevant to each symbol during the simulation. The method begins by extracting the name of the state class using `state.__class__.__name__`. It then iterates over all symbols defined in the exchange's configuration (`self.config.symbols`). For each symbol, it assigns the provided state instance to a dictionary `_symbol_states` under the key corresponding to the symbol and the state's class name. This setup ensures that multiple states can be registered for each symbol, identified by their respective class names.

Note: Usage points. The `register_state` method is typically called during the initialization or configuration phase of an exchange simulation. It allows developers to specify which state objects should be used to track and manage different aspects of trading sessions for each symbol. For example, in the provided usage scenario from `run_simulation.py`, a `TradeInfoState` instance is registered with the exchange. This registration ensures that trade information specific to each symbol is tracked throughout the simulation. Developers can extend this functionality by creating custom state classes that inherit from the base `State` class and registering them similarly to manage additional types of state information relevant to their simulations.

### FunctionDef set_order_id(self, order)
**set_order_id**: This function assigns a unique order ID to a given limit order within an exchange system.

parameters:
· order: An instance of the LimitOrder class representing the order for which a unique ID is to be set.

Code Description: The function takes a single parameter, `order`, which is expected to be an object of the `LimitOrder` class. Inside the function, it calls the `set_order_id` method on the `order` object, passing the current value of `_cur_order_id`. This effectively assigns the current order ID to the limit order. After setting the order ID, the function increments `_cur_order_id` by 1 to ensure that subsequent orders receive unique IDs.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where new orders are being submitted to the exchange and require a unique identifier for tracking purposes. The `set_order_id` function is typically called within methods responsible for handling order submissions, such as `submit_call_auction_order` and `submit_continuous_auction_order`, ensuring that each order processed by the exchange has a distinct ID. This mechanism helps in maintaining an organized and traceable record of all orders within the system.
***
### FunctionDef is_in_call_auction_period(self, time)
**is_in_call_auction_period**: This function determines whether a given timestamp falls within either the open auction period or the close auction period as defined by the exchange's configuration.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp representing the moment to be checked against the auction periods.

Code Description: The function checks if the provided timestamp is within two distinct periods: the open auction period and the close auction period. It utilizes another function, `is_in_period`, which evaluates whether a given time falls between specified start and end timestamps. If the timestamp is found within either of these periods, the function returns True, indicating that the timestamp is during an auction period. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note: This function is crucial for determining when certain actions, such as receiving call auction orders, should be processed by the exchange. It ensures that operations are only performed during designated auction times, maintaining the integrity and timing of trading activities.

Output Example: If the open auction period is from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and the close auction period is from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, calling `is_in_call_auction_period` with a timestamp of 9:30 AM would return True because it falls within the open auction period. Similarly, using a timestamp of 4:15 PM would also return True as it is within the close auction period. A timestamp of 12:00 PM, however, would result in False since it does not fall within either auction period.
***
### FunctionDef is_in_continuous_auction_period(self, time)
**is_in_continuous_auction_period**: This function determines whether a given timestamp falls within the continuous auction period defined by the exchange's configuration.

parameters:
· time: A Timestamp object representing the specific point in time to be checked against the continuous auction period.

Code Description: The function leverages another utility function, `is_in_period`, to check if the provided timestamp (`time`) is within the inclusive range specified by `continuous_auction_start_time` and `continuous_auction_end_time`. These start and end times are attributes of the exchange's configuration. If either the start or end time is not set (None), the function will return False, indicating that a valid continuous auction period cannot be determined.

Note: This function is crucial for determining if orders should be processed during the continuous auction phase in financial exchanges. It ensures that order processing logic specific to this period is only applied when appropriate.

Output Example: If `continuous_auction_start_time` is set to 10:00 AM and `continuous_auction_end_time` is set to 2:00 PM, calling `is_in_continuous_auction_period` with a timestamp of 1:00 PM will return True. Conversely, if the timestamp is 9:00 AM or 3:00 PM, it will return False as these times are outside the continuous auction period.

### FunctionDef match_call_auction_orders(self, time)
**match_call_auction_orders**: This function processes call auction orders for multiple symbols at a given time. It determines whether the current time falls within an open or close auction period and matches orders accordingly.

parameters:
· time: A timestamp indicating when the order matching should occur.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary named `results` to store transaction results, keyed by symbol. For each symbol configured in the system, it calls a private method `_match_call_auction_orders`, passing the current time and the symbol as arguments. This method handles the actual logic of order matching during auction periods. The results from this call are stored in the `results` dictionary under the corresponding symbol key. Finally, the function returns the `results` dictionary containing all transactions for each symbol.

Note: This function is typically called at specific times during trading sessions to handle auction processes, ensuring that orders are matched according to predefined rules during these critical periods. It plays a crucial role in maintaining fair and orderly market operations.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    'AAPL': [
        Transaction(time=1633072800, symbol='AAPL', type='M', price=150, volume=100, buy_id=[101], sell_id=[201], order_matched_volume={101: 100}),
        Transaction(time=1633072800, symbol='AAPL', type='C', price=0, volume=50, buy_id=[], sell_id=[202])
    ],
    'GOOGL': [
        Transaction(time=1633072800, symbol='GOOGL', type='M', price=2800, volume=200, buy_id=[102], sell_id=[203], order_matched_volume={102: 200})
    ]
}
This example illustrates that for the symbols 'AAPL' and 'GOOGL', several transactions were matched during the auction period. Each transaction includes details such as time, symbol, type (match or cancel), price, volume, buyer IDs, seller IDs, and optionally, a dictionary detailing the matched volumes of specific orders.

### FunctionDef states_snapshot(self)
**states_snapshot**: This function creates a copy of the current states stored within an instance of the Exchange class. It is designed to provide a snapshot of the internal state without modifying the original data, which can be useful for debugging or analysis purposes.

**parameters**:
· No parameters are required for this function. It operates on the internal state of the object it belongs to.

**Code Description**: The function utilizes Python's `deepcopy` method from the `copy` module to create a deep copy of the `_symbol_states` attribute. A deep copy means that all objects are recursively copied, ensuring that changes made to the returned snapshot do not affect the original states stored in the Exchange instance. This is particularly important when dealing with complex data structures where shallow copies would not suffice to prevent unintended side effects.

**Note**: Due to the performance implications of creating a deep copy, it is recommended to use this function judiciously and only when necessary. Frequent calls to `states_snapshot` could lead to increased memory usage and slower execution times.

**Output Example**: Assuming `_symbol_states` contains data about various symbols in an exchange, such as their prices and volumes, the output might look something like this:

{
    'AAPL': {'price': 150.25, 'volume': 1000},
    'GOOGL': {'price': 2800.75, 'volume': 500}
}

This example represents a simplified version of what the snapshot might contain, with actual data varying based on the specific implementation and current state of the Exchange instance.

### FunctionDef states(self)
**states**: This function returns the current states of symbols managed by an Exchange instance.
parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input parameters.

Code Description: The `states` method is a simple accessor within the `Exchange` class that provides access to the internal `_symbol_states` attribute. This attribute holds the state information for all symbols listed on the exchange, which can include various data points such as prices, volumes, and other trading-related metrics. By calling this method, external components or methods can retrieve the current state of symbols without needing direct access to the private `_symbol_states` attribute.

Note: Usage points highlight that the `states` function is utilized in several parts of the system where symbol states are required for processing. For example, it is used in market simulations to fetch trade information within a specific time frame and in engine operations to update agent observations and handle market close events.

Output Example: The output would be a dictionary-like structure where keys represent symbols (e.g., 'AAPL', 'GOOGL') and values are objects or dictionaries containing the state data for each symbol. Here is a mock-up of what this might look like:

{
    'AAPL': {'price': 150.25, 'volume': 1000000, ...},
    'GOOGL': {'price': 2800.75, 'volume': 500000, ...}
}

### FunctionDef get_lob(self, symbol)
**get_lob**: This function retrieves the order book associated with a specified trading symbol from an internal storage structure.
parameters:
· symbol: A string representing the trading symbol for which the order book is requested.

Code Description: The function `get_lob` takes a single argument, `symbol`, which is expected to be a string. It accesses an internal dictionary `_orderbooks` that maps trading symbols to their respective order books. The function returns the order book corresponding to the provided symbol by indexing into this dictionary with the `symbol` as the key.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the symbol passed to the function exists within the `_orderbooks` dictionary to avoid a KeyError. Developers should handle potential exceptions or check for the existence of the symbol before calling this function if there's any uncertainty about its presence in the order books.

Output Example: Assuming the `_orderbooks` dictionary contains an entry for 'AAPL' with data representing Apple Inc.'s stock order book, calling `get_lob('AAPL')` would return that specific order book data structure. The exact format of this data depends on how order books are structured within the application but could be a list of buy and sell orders with associated prices and quantities.
