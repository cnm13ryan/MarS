## ClassDef Orderbook
**Orderbook**: The Orderbook class represents a central component of a trading system where buy (bids) and sell (asks) orders for a specific financial instrument are stored, managed, and matched against each other.

attributes:
· symbol: A string representing the symbol or identifier of the financial instrument associated with this order book.
· bids: A list of Level objects that store buy orders at various price levels, sorted in descending order by price.
· asks: A list of Level objects that store sell orders at various price levels, sorted in ascending order by price.
· call_auction_orders: A list of LimitOrder objects representing orders placed during a call auction period.
· time: A pandas Timestamp object indicating the current time associated with the order book state.
· last_price: An integer representing the last traded price. It is initialized to -1, indicating no trades have occurred yet.

Code Description: The Orderbook class manages the lifecycle of buy and sell orders in a market simulation environment. It includes methods for adding call auction orders, matching these orders during an auction period, updating the order book with continuous auction orders, snapshotting the current state of the order book, retrieving specific price levels, finding the price of a given order ID, and handling internal operations such as clearing call auction orders and matching auction orders.

The `add_call_auction_order` method adds a LimitOrder to the call_auction_orders list and updates the time attribute. The `match_call_auction_orders` method matches orders during an auction period based on specified rules and returns any cancel transactions and match transactions that occurred. The `update` method processes continuous auction orders, updating the order book accordingly and returning trade information.

The `snapshot` method provides a snapshot of the current state of the order book up to a specified number of levels for both bids and asks. The `get_best_k_ask_bid` method retrieves the best kth ask and bid prices from the order book. The `get_price_of_order_id` method returns the price associated with a specific order ID, searching through both active orders and call auction orders.

Internal methods such as `_clear_call_auction_order`, `_macth_call_auction_orders`, `_match_auction_orders_and_update_orderbook`, `_find_matched_index`, `_clear_levels`, `_add_to_level`, and `_update_with_normal_order` handle the detailed logic of order matching, updating, and management within the order book.

Note: The Orderbook class is designed to be used in conjunction with other components of a trading simulation system, such as the Exchange class which manages multiple order books for different financial instruments. It plays a crucial role in simulating market dynamics by accurately reflecting the state of buy and sell orders and facilitating their matching based on market rules.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value from the `snapshot` method could be:
```
LobSnapshot(
    symbol='AAPL',
    time=Timestamp('2023-10-05 14:30:00'),
    bids=[
        Level(price=150, volume=100),
        Level(price=149.99, volume=75)
    ],
    asks=[
        Level(price=150.01, volume=200),
        Level(price=150.02, volume=150)
    ]
)
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, symbol)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Orderbook class, setting up necessary attributes to manage buy (bids) and sell (asks) orders, call auction orders, time, last price, and symbol.

parameters:
· symbol: A string representing the trading symbol or asset identifier for which this order book is created.

Code Description: The constructor initializes several key attributes of the Orderbook class. It sets up two lists to hold bid and ask levels (bids and asks), respectively. Each list will contain instances of the Level class, representing different price points in the order book where buy or sell orders are placed at specific prices. Another list is initialized for call auction orders, which might be used during special trading sessions or conditions.

The time attribute is intended to hold a pandas Timestamp object, likely representing the current time or the timestamp of the last update to the order book. The last_price attribute is initialized to -1 and will store the price at which the most recent trade occurred in this order book. Finally, the symbol attribute stores the trading symbol for which this order book is created, facilitating identification and management within a system that may handle multiple assets or securities.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of Orderbook by providing a valid trading symbol. This setup allows the order book to manage orders efficiently, track price levels, and maintain up-to-date information about trades and market conditions for the specified asset. For example, initializing an order book for a stock with the symbol "AAPL" would be done as follows:

```python
orderbook = Orderbook(symbol="AAPL")
```

This instance can then be used to add, cancel, or match orders, update prices, and track trading activity specific to Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock.
***
### FunctionDef add_call_auction_order(self, order)
**add_call_auction_order**: This function adds a call auction order to the order book.
parameters:
· order: An instance of the LimitOrder class representing the order to be added.

Code Description: The `add_call_auction_order` method is part of an Orderbook class and is designed to handle the addition of orders specifically during a call auction period. When this function is called, it takes a single parameter, `order`, which must be an instance of the `LimitOrder` class. This order represents the details of the trade that needs to be included in the order book for the call auction.

The method performs two main actions:
1. It updates the `time` attribute of the Orderbook instance to match the time of the incoming order. This ensures that the order book's timestamp is synchronized with the most recent order it processes.
2. It appends the provided `order` to a list named `call_auction_orders`. This list is specifically designed to hold all orders received during the call auction period, allowing for separate handling and processing of these orders compared to regular trading periods.

The use of this method is critical in maintaining accurate order book state during the call auction phase. It ensures that all orders are timestamped correctly and stored appropriately for further processing or analysis.

Note: This function is typically invoked by higher-level functions such as `submit_call_auction_order` in the Exchange class, which handles the validation and submission of orders during the call auction period. The method plays a vital role in ensuring that the order book accurately reflects all trades made during this special trading phase. Developers should ensure that only valid `LimitOrder` instances are passed to this function to maintain data integrity within the order book.
***
### FunctionDef match_call_auction_orders(self, time, type)
**match_call_auction_orders**: This function processes call auction orders at specified times (either open or close) by canceling any canceled orders, matching remaining orders based on a specific price determined during the auction, and updating the last price of the orderbook if a match occurs.

**parameters**:
· time: A timestamp indicating when the auction is taking place.
· type: A string that specifies whether the auction is for opening ("OPEN") or closing ("CLOSE").

**Code Description**: The function begins by asserting that the `type` parameter is either "OPEN" or "CLOSE". It then sets the `time` attribute of the orderbook to the provided timestamp. The function proceeds to cancel any orders marked as canceled during the auction period using `_del_canceled_call_auction_orders`. This method returns a list of transactions related to these cancellations.

Next, it matches the remaining call auction orders by calling `_macth_call_auction_orders` with the current time and auction type. This method sorts and groups the orders, determines the final price for the auction based on volume, and attempts to match buy and sell orders at this price. If a successful match occurs, the function updates the last price of the orderbook using `update_last_price`, passing in the matched transaction.

The function returns two values: a list of cancel transactions and the match transaction (if any). The cancel transactions represent all cancellations that occurred during the auction, while the match transaction represents the trade executed at the auction's final price.

**Note**: This function is crucial for handling special auction periods in trading systems where order matching occurs under specific rules. It ensures that orders are processed correctly and that the last traded price is updated accurately after an auction.

**Output Example**: 
A possible return value from this function could be:
```
(
    [
        Transaction(symbol='AAPL', time=1633072800, type='C', price=0, volume=50, buy_id=[], sell_id=[101]),
        Transaction(symbol='AAPL', time=1633072800, type='C', price=0, volume=30, buy_id=[102], sell_id=[])
    ],
    Transaction(symbol='AAPL', time=1633072800, type='M', price=150.0, volume=100, buy_id=[103], sell_id=[104])
)
```
In this example, two orders were canceled during the auction period, and one match transaction occurred at a price of 150.0 with a volume of 100 shares between buyer order ID 103 and seller order ID 104.

### FunctionDef update_last_price(self, transaction)
**update_last_price**: This function updates the last price of an orderbook based on a given transaction. It checks if the transaction type is either "B" (Buy) or "S" (Sell), and if so, it sets the `last_price` attribute of the orderbook to the price of the transaction.

**parameters**:
· transaction: An instance of the Transaction class representing a trade that has occurred in the market. This object contains details such as the time of the transaction, symbol traded, type (Buy or Sell), price, volume, and IDs of the buy and sell orders involved.

**Code Description**: The function `update_last_price` is designed to update the last recorded price in an orderbook after a trade has taken place. It accepts a single parameter, `transaction`, which must be an instance of the Transaction class. Inside the function, there is a conditional check to determine if the transaction type (`transaction.type`) is either "B" (indicating a Buy transaction) or "S" (indicating a Sell transaction). If this condition is met, the function updates the `last_price` attribute of the orderbook instance with the price from the transaction. This ensures that the last known price in the orderbook reflects the most recent trade.

**Note**: The function assumes that the transaction type will be either "B" or "S". Any other transaction types are ignored, and no update to `last_price` occurs. This function is typically called after a successful match of buy and sell orders, as seen in the `match_call_auction_orders` and `update` methods of the Orderbook class. These methods handle the logic for matching orders and then call `update_last_price` to reflect the new last price based on the executed transaction.
***
### FunctionDef snapshot(self, level)
**snapshot**: This function generates a snapshot of the current state of the order book at a specified depth level.
parameters:
· level: An integer representing the maximum number of price levels to include in the snapshot from both the ask and bid sides. The default value is 10.

Code Description: The `snapshot` method captures the current state of the order book by extracting a specified number of top price levels (determined by the `level` parameter) from both the ask and bid sides. It then constructs an instance of the `LobSnapshot` class, which encapsulates this information along with other relevant details such as the timestamp, last transaction price, and lists of prices and volumes for both asks and bids.

The method first slices the `asks` and `bids` lists to include only the top `level` entries. It then creates a new `LobSnapshot` object by passing in:
- The current time (`self.time`)
- The maximum level specified (`max_level=level`)
- The last price of the order book (`last_price=self.last_price`)
- Lists of prices and volumes for asks and bids, derived from the sliced lists

The resulting `LobSnapshot` object provides a comprehensive snapshot of the order book's state at that moment in time, which can be used for analysis, reporting, or further processing.

Note: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where developers need to capture and analyze the state of an order book at specific points in time. It allows for flexible control over the depth of detail captured by adjusting the `level` parameter.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value when accessing its attributes and properties could look like this:
- time: 2023-10-05 14:30:00
- max_level: 10
- last_price: 15000
- ask_prices: [15005, 15010, 15015]
- ask_volumes: [200, 150, 300]
- bid_prices: [14995, 14990, 14985]
- bid_volumes: [250, 175, 225]
- spread: 10
- mid_price: 15000
- float_mid_price: 15000.0
- float_weighted_mid_price: 14998.333333333334
***
### FunctionDef get_best_k_ask_bid(self, k)
**get_best_k_ask_bid**: This function retrieves the k-th best ask and bid prices from an order book.
parameters:
· k: An integer representing the rank of the price to retrieve, with 1 being the best (lowest for asks, highest for bids). The default value is 5.

Code Description: The function starts by initializing two variables, `ask_k` and `bid_k`, to -1. These will store the k-th best ask and bid prices respectively if they exist. It then checks if there are at least `k` entries in the asks list. If so, it creates a list of ask prices from the objects in `self.asks`. The k-th lowest ask price is then assigned to `ask_k`. Similarly, for bids, it checks if there are at least `k` entries and retrieves the k-th highest bid price, assigning it to `bid_k`. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing both `ask_k` and `bid_k`.

Note: If there are fewer than `k` asks or bids in the order book, the corresponding value in the returned tuple will be -1.

Output Example: Suppose the ask prices are [100, 102, 105, 108, 110] and bid prices are [107, 104, 103, 101, 99]. Calling `get_best_k_ask_bid(3)` would return (105, 103), as 105 is the third lowest ask price and 103 is the third highest bid price. If we call `get_best_k_ask_bid(6)`, it would return (-1, -1) since there are not enough asks or bids to satisfy the request for the sixth best price in either category.
***
### FunctionDef get_price_of_order_id(self, order_id)
**get_price_of_order_id**: This function retrieves the price associated with a specific order ID from an order book. It searches through both ask and bid levels as well as call auction orders to find the matching order.

parameters:
· order_id: An integer representing the unique identifier of the order whose price is to be retrieved.

Code Description: The `get_price_of_order_id` method starts by creating a list named `levels` that combines all ask and bid levels from the order book. It then iterates through each level in this combined list, using the `has_order_id` method of the `Level` class to check if the specified `order_id` exists within any of these levels. If an order with the given ID is found, the function returns the price of that level.

If no matching order is found among the ask and bid levels, the function proceeds to search through a list of call auction orders. For each order in this list, it checks if the `order_id` matches. If a match is found, the function returns the price of that specific order.

In cases where the specified `order_id` does not exist in either the ask/bid levels or the call auction orders, the function raises a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the order ID was not found within the order book or call auction orders.

Note: This method is useful for retrieving the price of an order when only its unique identifier is known. It ensures that the search covers all possible locations where the order might be stored within the system, including both regular market levels and special call auction orders.

Output Example: If the `order_id` 12345 corresponds to an order in one of the bid levels with a price of 98.76, calling `get_price_of_order_id(12345)` would return `98.76`. Similarly, if the same ID is found in the call auction orders with a price of 99.00, it would also return `99.00`. If the order ID does not exist anywhere in the order book or call auction orders, a `RuntimeError` will be raised with the message "order id 12345 not existed in orderbook/call_auction_orders."
***
### FunctionDef _clear_call_auction_order(self)
**_clear_call_auction_order**: This function processes and clears orders that were part of a call auction. It iterates through each order in the `call_auction_orders` list, updates the orderbook with these orders using the `_update_with_normal_order` method, and then clears the `call_auction_orders` list.

**parameters**:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function starts by iterating over each order in the `self.call_auction_orders` list. For each order, it calls the `_update_with_normal_order` method to attempt to match and update the orderbook with this order. The result of this operation is stored in the variable `trans`. An assertion checks that `trans` is not truthy, indicating no transactions were made during this process (which aligns with the typical behavior expected in a call auction clearing where orders are either matched or canceled without partial fills).

After processing all orders, the function clears the `self.call_auction_orders` list to remove these processed orders from the orderbook.

**Note**: This function is typically called after the call auction has been matched and settled. It ensures that any remaining orders in the call auction are properly handled (either matched or canceled) and then cleans up by clearing the relevant list of orders. Developers should ensure that `_update_with_normal_order` behaves as expected to maintain the integrity of the orderbook during this process. Beginners should understand that this function is part of a larger mechanism for handling special auction conditions in an orderbook system.

### FunctionDef _find_matched_index(self, price, levels)
**_find_matched_index**: This function searches through a list of price levels to find the index of the level that matches a specified price.

parameters:
· price: An integer representing the price at which the order is placed.
· levels: A list of Level objects, each representing a price level in an order book.

Code Description: The _find_matched_index function iterates over a list of Level objects to locate the index of the level whose price attribute matches the given price parameter. It initializes an index variable with -1, indicating that no match has been found yet. As it loops through each level in the levels list, it checks if the current level's price is equal to the specified price. If a match is found, it updates the index variable with the current loop index and breaks out of the loop. The function then returns the index, which will either be -1 (if no matching price was found) or the index of the matched Level object.

Note: This function is typically used within an order book system to efficiently locate a specific price level for operations such as adding, canceling, or updating orders at that price. It ensures that the correct level can be accessed and manipulated based on the given price.

Output Example: If the levels list contains three Level objects with prices 100, 200, and 300 respectively, and the function is called with a price of 200, it will return 1, indicating that the level with price 200 is located at index 1 in the levels list. If no matching price is found, for example, if the price is 400, the function will return -1.
***
### FunctionDef _clear_levels(self, level_indexes, levels)
**_clear_levels**: This function is designed to remove specified levels from a list of price levels within an order book. It takes two parameters: a list of indices indicating which levels should be removed, and the list of levels itself.

parameters:
· level_indexes: A list of integers representing the indexes of the levels that need to be cleared or removed.
· levels: A list of Level objects from which specified levels will be removed based on the provided indexes.

Code Description: The function iterates over the `level_indexes` in reverse order. This reverse iteration is crucial because removing elements from a list while iterating forward can lead to incorrect index references, as the indices of subsequent elements change after each removal. By starting from the end and moving towards the beginning, the function ensures that removing an element does not affect the remaining indexes that need to be processed.

For each index in `level_indexes`, the function calls the `pop` method on the `levels` list, effectively removing the Level object at that index. This operation is repeated for all indices provided in `level_indexes`.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where certain price levels have been emptied of orders and need to be removed from the order book's bid or ask side lists to maintain an accurate representation of active price levels. The `_clear_levels` function is typically called after processing orders that may have depleted one or more price levels, ensuring that the order book remains up-to-date and efficient. This function plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the order book system by removing unnecessary data.

## FunctionDef _get_call_auction_final_price(sell_levels, buy_levels, prices)
**_get_call_auction_final_price**: This function calculates the final price during a call auction by determining the price level where the total volume of buy and sell orders is maximized, while ensuring that the buy volume minus the sell volume at or above/below this price does not exceed zero.

parameters:
· sell_levels: A dictionary mapping each sell price to its corresponding Level object, representing all sell orders at that price.
· buy_levels: A dictionary mapping each buy price to its corresponding Level object, representing all buy orders at that price.
· prices: A set of unique prices present in the order book, which are candidates for the final auction price.

Code Description: The function iterates over each candidate price in the `prices` set. For each price, it calculates the total volume of sell and buy orders above or below this price (excluding equal-priced orders). It also tracks the volume of orders exactly at the current price level for both buy and sell sides. If the difference between the cumulative buy and sell volumes (considering only those strictly greater/lesser than the current price) indicates an imbalance that would prevent a fair auction, the function skips this price. Otherwise, it calculates the total possible trade volume at this price by taking the minimum of the sum of equal-price buy and sell volumes. If this total volume is higher than any previously recorded maximum volume, the function updates its record to reflect the new highest volume along with the corresponding price and the exact volumes of buy and sell orders that would be executed at this price.

Note: This function plays a critical role in determining the fair clearing price during a call auction by ensuring that the market clears as much volume as possible without favoring one side over the other. It is used within the `_macth_call_auction_orders` method to finalize the auction process after all orders have been grouped into their respective levels.

Output Example: If the function determines that the highest total trade volume of 100 units can be achieved at a price of 50, with 30 units from buy orders and 20 units from sell orders being executed at this exact price level, it would return (100, 50, 30, 20). This indicates that the final auction price is 50, with a total trade volume of 100 units, where 30 units are filled by buy orders and 20 units by sell orders at this price.
