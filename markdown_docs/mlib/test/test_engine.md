## FunctionDef main
**main**: The main function serves as the entry point to execute the test engine functionality within the project. It initializes and runs a series of operations designed for testing purposes.

parameters:
Â· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Upon invocation, the `main` function calls another function named `test_engine_run`. The `test_engine_run` function is responsible for setting up a simulated trading environment with specific configurations. It initializes an exchange with predefined market opening and closing times, along with a list of symbols (in this case, "000001"). After configuring the exchange, it creates a set of events that simulate various activities within the market. An `Engine` object is then instantiated with the configured exchange and set to verbose mode for detailed output. The engine processes these events and runs the simulation.

Note: Usage points include invoking this function as the starting point for running tests in the project's testing framework. Developers can modify the parameters within `test_engine_run`, such as market times or symbols, to tailor the test scenarios according to their needs. Beginners should ensure they understand the configurations and event creation process before modifying these settings to avoid unexpected behavior in the simulation.
